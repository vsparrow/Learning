  CLASS METHODS    
    ATTR_ACCESSORS    get or set attributes of an instance once you've retrieved it:
                        student = Student.find_by(name: 'Jon')
                        student.name          #=> 'Jon' 
                        student.name = 'Steve'
                        student.name          #=> 'Steve'
    Callbacks         #similar to how you use has_many or validates#They are at the top of your model files.
      before_save       called after validation occurs #non model attribute , then use before_save.
      before_validation Whenever you are modifying an attribute of the model, use before_validation
      before_create.    like before_save but only gets called when a model is created for the first time. 
                          This means not every time the object is persisted, just when it is new.
      Example:
                          before_validation we want to run this whenever someone tries to save to the database. This is where the before_save
                          before_save whenever you save to the database, let's send an email to the Author alerting them that the post was just saved!
                          class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
                            belongs_to :author
                            validate :is_title_case
                            before_validation :make_title_case  ########### New Code!! #could be before_save
                            before_save :email_author_about_post
                            private
                            def is_title_case
                              if title.split.any?{|w|w[0].upcase != w[0]} errors.add(:title, "Title must be in title case") end
                            end
                            def make_title_case  self.title = self.title.titlecase end
                          end
                        
    change column       change_column(table_name, column_name, type)   (see update table below for file structure)                   
    CREATE A TABLE
                      sql = <<-SQL  CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS students (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT) SQL 
                      ActiveRecord::Base.connection.execute(sql)
    CONNECT TO DB
                      connection = ActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection(
                        :adapter => "sqlite3",
                        :database => "db/students.sqlite"  )
    inherit           from ActiveRecord::Base         class Student < ActiveRecord::Base
    update object     And then save those changes to the database:
                        student = Student.find_by(name: 'Jon')
                        student.name = 'Steve'
                        student.save
                        Note that our Student class doesn't have any methods defined for #name either. 
                        Nor does it make use of Ruby's built-in attr_accessor method.
    update table      we need a new migration
                        make new file in migrate. incrrementnumber_ChangeType_ColumnName_to_Classname.rb# 
                          ex: db/migrate/02_add_favorite_food_to_artists.rb
                        in file: 
                            class AddFavoriteFoodToArtists < ActiveRecord::Migration
                              def change
                                add_column :artists, :favorite_food, :string       #rake db:migrate after to run migration
                        
  Console             see TESTING                      
                        
  File structure      every file should require config/environemnt.rb
                      ./CLASSNAME.rb
                        define class. inherit from AR. ex . class Artist < ActiveRecord::Base
                      ./Rakefile
                        require 'sinatra/activerecord/rake' to auto add commands like rake db:migrate, etc                   
                      config/environment.rb
                        create connection to be,create table. run connection.execute(sql db. 
                         also put your require files, and gems like rake here
                      db/migrate/01_create_CLASSNAME.rb  #first file of migrations. numbered so AR knows how to create/reverse
                        def CreateClassName< < ActiveRecord::Migration /n def change /n  CREATE TABLE 
                        
                        
  Migration Methods   used to start a migration. (do search def change to see implementation in ORM)
    up method         define the code to execute when the migration is run          Think of it like "do"
    change method     like up and down combined. more common for basic migrations. AR does automatic changes with change
    down method       define the code to execute when the migration is rolled back. Think of it like "undo."

  TESTING
    rake console      use this rather than irb. it knows the environemnt that is setup
    
  Useage                    CRUD methods for use with AR . see also http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_basics.html#crud-reading-and-writing-data
    Artist                  call the class # => Artist (call 'Artist.connection' to establish a connection)
    A.all                   return array of class items from db  
    A.create(name: 'Kelly') new instance and save
    A.column = value        set a column to a value # a.age = 30
    A.find                  retrieve  from the database by id:       Student.find(1)
    A.find_by(name: 'Jon')  find by name
    A.column_names          list columns
    Artist.new(name: 'Jon') new instance
    a.save                  update/save changes


SORT THIS:::
code go to creating a model, which resides in the app/models folder, and a migration, which resides in the db/migrate folder.
The model inherits from ActiveRecord::Base while the migration inherits from ActiveRecord::Migration
naming conventions: while the migrations are plural, the models are singular.
class names in the migration files must match their file names. For instance, a class in the migration file called 
  20141013204115_create_candies.rb must be named CreateCandies while 
  a class in a migration file called 20130915204319_add_addresses_to_houses.rb must be called AddAddressesToHouses.
Migrations usually have a method called change. In change, you can create a table with the create_table method. 
QURSTION::  model is the class (class Dog < ActiveRecord::Base) while migration creates the table,changes,updates     

create your migration file.       rake db:create_migration NAME=create_movies #Once you have a migration file add columns 
migrate your table                rake db:migrate # After your migration is ready run   
migrate a test database           rake db:migrate SINATRA_ENV=test

  Sinatra and Active record steps
    GEMFILE
    add gems      three gems to allow us to use ActiveRecord: activerecord version 4.2.5, sinatra-activerecord, and rake.
                    Make sure those three gems are in your Gemfile:
                  Into development group, we'll add two other gems: sqlite3 and tux.                        
                        gem 'sinatra'  #Gemfile
                        gem 'activerecord', '4.2.5'
                        gem 'sinatra-activerecord'
                        gem 'thin'
                        gem 'require_all'
                        group :development do
                          gem 'shotgun'
                          gem 'pry'
                          gem 'tux'
                          gem 'sqlite3'
                        end                        # end Gemfile
    setup db      Addfollowing code to your environment.rb file (underneath Bundler.require(:default, ENV['SINATRA_ENV'])). 
                      configure :development do
                        set :database, 'sqlite3:db/database.db' #or change to 'sqlite3:db/dogs.db' # for a dogs database
                      end #This sets up a connection to a sqlite3 database named "database.db", located in folder called "db.
    Rakefile      require our config/environment.rb file to load up our environment, as well as the gems we need
                          require './config/environment'
                          require 'sinatra/activerecord/rake' #this will give you tasks that come from Rake -T
    migration:    rake db:create_migration NAME=create_dogs  #now do AR stuff like add def change and create_table
                  rake db:migrate                          
BASH ****************************************************************
SEE ALSO SHELL
variable      is characterized by a dollar sign followed by a variable name.    
                Conventionally, environment variable names consist of all uppercase letters. One example of this is $PATH.                more info   http://blog.seldomatt.com/blog/2012/10/08/bash-and-the-one-true-path/

$PATH         a colon-separated list of paths. Each path is just the location of a directory (or "folder") on your system.
                can be defined in a few different places on your computer:
                For an individual user: ~/.bash_profile  OR  ~/.bashrc
                For global changes: /etc/profile  OR /etc/bashrc
                BASH looks in your .bash_profile first, you should be setting most of your environment variables and methods there 
                when your computer tries to run Ruby? to find the right version, it searches through the directories listed, in order.
                more info   http://blog.seldomatt.com/blog/2012/10/08/bash-and-the-one-true-path/
                
echo $PATH.   terminal should print the value of your $PATH variable. 
                echo $PATH | tr ":" "\n"      
                  this looks like an indecipherable string of characters. So let's replace the colons with line breaks.
                  
ps            get processes
ps aux        a = show processes for all users u = display the process's user/owner x = also show processes not attached to a terminal
                ps aux | grep ruby    find ruby in ps

CSS  ****************************************************************
 Architecture CSS promotes breaking up styles into five core categories, Base,Layout,Module,State,Theme see tools for link
              base category includes core element styles, covering the general defaults. 
              layout category then identifies the sizing and grid styles of different elements, determining their layout. 
              Module styles are more specific styles targeting individual parts of the page, such as navigation or feature styles. 
              state styles are then used to augment or override other styles in the event that a module includes an alternate state,
                an active tab for example. 
              theme category may be added which could include styles based around the skin, or look and feel, of different modules.
  selectors   Keep Selectors Short  for performance
              Favor Classes  
   

 Language
  hsla        Hue Saturation Lightness and Alpha it's a way of declaring color in CSS.    background-color: hsla(170, 50%, 45%, 1);
                similar to RGBa ; declare three values determining the color and then a fourth value for its transparency level.
                The real appeal of HSLa is that it makes more intuitive sense what changing the values will do to the color.
                That makes creating your own color variations on the fly way easier.
                see https://css-tricks.com/yay-for-hsla/
  @import url() 
              allows you to import other css files into your css file. example used to import fonts
  Pseudo-classes                  
              special classes used to add special effects to some selectors, which are applied automatically in certain states.  
                :visited in    a:visited { text-decoration: underline; }
  Pseudo-elements 
              is a specific/unique part of an element that can be used to generate content “on the fly”, automatic numbering and lists. 
                :first-line or :after in  p:first-line { font-variant: small-caps; }  a:link:after { content: " (" attr(href) ")"; }
 
 
 Layout 
  Box Model    Dictates how browser sizes elements. determines actual true size and how much space taken up in layout.
                Every element can be seen as a box. has Wdith, height, padding, margin, border
              IE vs W3C   two different box models:: ie: width specifies content+padding+ border   w3c: width specifies content only  
    IE          to calc "true content space" subtract padding+border from width  
    W3C         "true width" is calculated via adding width(content) padding boder. in IE model, width is true width 
  border      outside element
  box-sizing: property to choose between models # ie is border-box # w3c is content-box  div {box-sizing : border-box }
  center elm  set margin to auto
  clear       see Floating
  content     the element
  display                 csome elements by nature are block like div, others are inline like span. override using display
  display block           appears side by side. not take width or top/bottom margin. 
                            margins dont overlap. width 10px each for 2 spans. get 20px
  display inline          display one above another take whole line. allows width or top/bottom margin
                            margins overlap. so 2 divs with margin 10px each does not make 20px margin, just 10px.
  display inline-block    appears side by side, allows width or top/bottom margin
  display table-cell      elements act liek they are the cells of a table. 
  Floating:   pull elements left or right. affects rlements that come after it but not before
    clear     clear : left, clear anything to the left # clear:right clear anything to right # both: clear both
    clear-fix gives parent elemet that collapses a reference forr how tall to be. take space to surround children
                .clearfix:after {} . it goes in after children and adds a period symbol. tells period to display block
                then clear both to clear floating children above it. then sets the period invisible and hieght and wdith of period to 0
  Height:      body always 100% wide, but only as high as content inside. 
                so if want element to scale 100% browser height, set body and html to 100% also  body,html{height: 100%;min-height: 100%}

                if you add margin, remember it doesnt calculaate into box-model(ie) or w3c sizing so must do math to get sizing right
  overflow    content overflow: visible( content overflows), hidden (content hidden) , scroll, auto (detect and create scroll if need)
  padding     spacing inside element               
  positioning
              relative  take element relative to where it WAS positioned. top:25px push down 25px from top; left:300px push left 200px
              absolute  refer to position relative to relativly possitioned parent or entire browser window.
              fixed     element will stay in palce when browser window scrolls. similar to absolute except for parent clause
              static    no positioning, override any previous positions
  z-index     layer elements on top of each other. by default everything zindex of 0. setting negative means go behind everything
                the higher the number the closer to screen

 Scaling:
  Elastic     em  in proportion to text size changing up and down:  Pro: containers stay in proporation to text 
                Cons: lots of testing as parent containers may start bumping into each other     
                16px = 1em ; if you want box to be ~200px  formula  is 200px/16px = 12.5em    desiredsize/em = neededEM
                so when text gets larger, container will get larger. if body is 2x, 12.5em will size out to 400px
  Fixed       px  Pro: same for all screens  Con:  much whitespace for large screen, small screen might need scrolling
  Fluid       %   based on percentage of space withing parent container Pro: use full screen, eliminate horizontal scroll bar 
                Cons: less control over what user sees 
  Min/Max     set thresholds  for width and hieght 
  
                
 Selectors        (see also Specificity)
  :: 	            pseudo element 	selects some actual content 	0 0 0 1
  : 	            pseudo selector 	selects elements in certain conditions 	0 0 1 0
  A[attribute]    Select all elements that have a specific attribute  (can just be [for]) to select <plate for="luke"> 
                    a[href] selects all a elements that have a href="anything" attribute.
  Attribute Dash seperated    select and attrib that is dash seperated p[class!="dog"]  <p class="new-dog-school">                    
  Attribute Ends With 
                  [attribute$="value"]   Select all elements with an attribute value that ends with specific characters                
  Attribute Starts With               [for^="Sa"]   for SaranWrap and Sardines
                  [attribute^="value"]  Select all elements with an attribute value that starts with specific characters

  [attribute="value"]   Select all elements that have a specific attribute value         
  Attribute Wildcard 
                  attribute*="value"] Select all elements with an attribute value that contains specific characters anywhere
                  mg[src*="/thumbnails/"] selects all image elements that show images from the "thumbnails" folder.
                  [class*="heading"] selects all elements with "heading" in their class, like class="main-heading" class="sub-heading"
  Child           A > B Select direct children of an element
  Child (First)   orange:first-child  Select a first child element inside of another element
  Child none      see :empty
  Child (Last)    pickle :last-child Select the last element inside of another element
  Child (Nth)     Select an element by its order in another element      div p:nth-child(2) selects the second p every div
  Child (Nth Last Child)  This is like nth-child, but counting from the back!
  Child (only)    :only-child  Select an element that are the only element inside of another one.
                    ul li:only-child selects the only li element that are in a ul
  Class Combine   orange.small  <orange class="small">; <orange> ; <apple class="small">  # only choose element orange with class small
  Combinator (Comma)  plate, bento  select element plate and element bento
  Combinator Universal      p *     selects every element inside all p elements. but NOT the p element
  :empty              Selects elements that don't have any other elements inside of them.
  :not(X)             Select all elements that don't match the negation selector
  :focus              will select links that are the current focus of the keyboard. can be used for input as well
  Content related
    ::before        add content before a certain element. ex: adding an opening quote before a blockquote 
                      or perhaps an preceding image to set apart a particular paragraph.
    ::after         add content after a certain element. For example, a closing quote to a blockquote. 
                       Also used commonly for the clearfix, where an empty space is added after the element which clears the float 
                       without any need for extra HTML markup.
  Input
    :checked        Selects checkboxes that are, wait for it, checked.
    :enabled        Selects inputs that are in the default state of enabled and ready to be used.
    :disabled       Selects inputs that have the disabled attribute. 
    :indeterminate  Selects radio buttons that are in the purgatory state of neither chosen or unchosen 
        
  Link              see also :focus
    :active         Selects the link while it is being activated (being clicked on or otherwise activated). 
                      example, for the "pressed" state of a button-style link or to make all links feel more button-like.
    :hover          When the mouse cursor rolls over a link, that link is in it's hover state and this will select it.
    :link           Aren't all <a> links? Well not if they don't have an href attribute. This selects only those that do
    :target         used in conjunction with IDs, and match when the hash tag in the current URL matches that ID. 
                    if at URL www.yoursite.com/#home then the selector #home:target will match. 
                    That can be extremely powerful. For example, you can create a tabbed area where the tabs link to hash tags 
                    and then the panels "activate" by matching :target selectors and (for example) using z-index to move to the top.                  
    :visited        Selects links that have already been visited by the current browser.

  :root             Selects the element that is at the root of the document. Almost certainly will select the <html> element
  Sibling (Adjacent)     p + .intro    selects every element with class="intro" that directly follows a p  (all into next to p)
  Sibling (General)   A ~ B         selects all B that follow a A       B A BB P B   -> this would get the middle two B 
  Text
    ::first-letter  Selects the first letter of the text in the element. Typical use: dropcaps.
    ::first-line    Selects the first line of text in the element. Typical use: setting the first sentence in small-caps as a typographical eye-catcher / lead-in.
    
  Type first-of-type          pickle:first-of-type Selects the first element of that type within another element.
  Type :last-of-type          Selects each last element of that type within another element. Remember type refers the kind of tag,
                                  so p and span are different types. 
  Type :nth-of-type(A)        Selects a specific element based on its type and order in another element 
                                .example:nth-of-type(odd); selects all odd instances of a the example class.
                                div:nth-of-type(2) selects the second instance of a div.
  Type: Nth-of-type with Formula  selects every nth element, starting the count at a specific instance of that element.
                    span:nth-of-type(6n+2) selects every 6th instance of a span, starting from (and including) the second instance.
  Type :only-of-type    Selects the only element of its type within another element.       
  
  
 Specificity
  calculator                  see CSS:Tools
  Equal specificity           the latest rule is the one that counts
  !important                  declaration overrides normal declarations, but avoid it
  link styling                To ensure that you see your various link styles, put your styles in the order 
                                “link-visited-hover-active”, or “LVHA” for short.”
  measure specificity         1000 for inline style , 100 for each ID, add 10 for each attribute, class or pseudo-class, 
                                add 1 for each element name or pseudo-element.
                                ex: body #content .data img:hover  specificity value would be 122 (0,1,2,2 or 0122): 
                                      100 for #content, 10 for .data, 10 for :hover, 1 for body and 1 for img.

ERB  ****************************************************************
Embedded Ruby         ERB and other templating engines allow us to modify the content and structure of our HTML code.
  Substituion tag     <%= and closes with %>. Inside of these tags, you can write any valid Ruby code that you want.
  Scripting tags      <% and close with %>. They evaluate –– but do not actually display –– Ruby code.

hashes
                      ERB assumes the name of top-level hash is the first key,
                      so code to call value associated with the nested "name" key would be student["name"].
                          params = { #MULTIPLE COURSES
                            "student" => {
                              "name" => "Vic",
                              "grade" => "12",
                              "courses" => [  # <- ARRAY
                                {
                                  "name" => "AP US History",
                                  "topic" => "History"
                                },
                                {
                                  "name" => "AP Human Geography",
                                  "topic" => "History"
                                }
                              ]  # <- end ARRAY
                            }
                          }

  Hashes
    forms
                        Instead of manually indexing each entry, we can use an empty array ([]) in our form view,
                         and ERB will automagically index the array for us,
                         turning my_hash["student"]["courses"][0]["name"] into student[courses][][name]    
                              <form action="/student" method="post">
                                Student Name: <input type="text" name="student[name]">
                                Student Grade: <input type="text" name="student[grade]">
                          #we dont need to add value in erb, we would in RUBY erb assumes value by placement
                                Course Name: <input type="text" name="student[courses][][name]">  
                                Course Topic: <input type="text" name="student[courses][][topic]">

                                        git fetch (<source>:<destination>) works like git push origin (<source>:<destination>)
                                        but <source> is now a place on the remote and <destination> is a local place 
git fetch origin foo                go to the foo branch on the remote, grab all the commits that aren't present locally,
                                     and then plop them down onto the o/foo branch locally.                                       
git fetch origin :<destination>     creates destination locally from head of origin
force                               git branch -f master HEAD~3 #directly reassign a branch to a commit with the -f option.

git push -u branch-name             sets this information for the branch you're pushing.
                                      important if created branch locally, then tells remote that you push to new branch
git push origin <source>:<destination>
                                    specify both source and destination of <place>, join the two together with a colon:
                                      referred to as a colon refspec. Refspec is just a fancy name for a location 
                                      that git can figure out (like the branch foo or even just HEAD~1)                                     
                                      if destination doesnt exist it is created 
git push origin :<destination>      notice no <source>? it will delete the remote destination because it merges "nothing"

git rebase -i NAME                  interactive rebase means is using the rebase command with the -i option.
                                      git will open up a UI to show you which commits are about to be copied below the target
                                      of the rebase. It also shows their commit hashes and messages
                                      
relative reference                  see git checkout head~4
                                      takes in a trailing number that specifies the number of parents you would like to ascend.
git remote                          lists the shortnames of each remote handle you’ve specified
                                       -v, shows URLs that Git has stored for the shortname to be used when reading and 
                                        writing to that remote:
git remote add <shortname> <url>    add a new remote Git repository as a shortname you can reference easily
git remote show <remote>            see more information about a particular remote   (git remote show origin) 
git remote rename                   change a remote’s shortname. ex rename pb to paul,  git remote rename pb paul
git reset --hard <commit id>        will move a branch backwards as if the commit had never been made in the first place.
                                      git reset HEAD~1 . (moves head up 1).   Does not work for remote branch, use revert.
git revert                          reverse changes and share those reversed changes with others,
                                      a new commit below the commit we wanted to reverse. 
                                      new commit C2' introduces changes that exactly reverses the commit of C2.
git rm                              remove file : remvoe from git  and remove from working directory so its not untracked
git status                          to see the status of your locally cloned git repository.
git tag                             (somewhat) permanently mark certain commits as "milestones" that you can reference 
                                      like a branch. More importantly though, they never move as more commits are created.
                                      You can't "check out" a tag and then complete work on that tag -- tags exist as anchors
                                      in the commit tree that designate certain spots.
                                      git tag v1 C1 # a tag at C1 which is our version 1 prototype

^ modifier                          Like the ~ modifier, the ^ modifier also accepts an optional number after it.
                                      the modifier on ^ specifies which parent reference to follow from a merge commit.
                                      Remember that merge commits have multiple parents, so the path to choose is ambiguous.
                                      Git will normally follow the "first" parent upwards from a merge commit, 
                                      but specifying a number with ^ changes this default behavior.

JAVASCRIPT ***********************************************************
 ***DOCUMENT MANIPULATION  go to end ******
 A statement is a unit of code that accomplishes something but does not produce a value.
 An expression is a unit of code that produces a value.
   Variable declarations: const, let, var
   Iteration: for, for...in, for...of, while
   Control flow: if...else, switch, break
   Debugging: debugger
   All of those keywords are extremely useful, but none of them generate a value on their own

API                     see DataRetrieval

ARGUMENTS + Variables
  arguments object      The arguments object doesn't have a slice method, because it isn't an array,
                          so we have to go through Array.prototype to get to the slice function
                          const customers = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments);  
  const                 var that cannot be reassigned
  identifier            when we declare a variable or a function, we provide a name that allows us to refer back to it:
                         We call those names identifiers because they allow us to identify the variable or function we're 
                          referring to.
  hoisting              jsengine moving declarations to top virtuall in memory
                         hoisting only applies to variable declarations; not variable assignments
  interpolation         `${}`  must be between tick not quote
  keywordless variables   Variables created without a const, let, or var keyword are always globally-scoped, 
                            regardless of where they sit inyour code.
                              if (true) {  lastName = 'Lovelace';}
                              lastName;// => "Lovelace"
  let                   new var in js6, use when variable change
  lexical x             lexical scoping, and lexical environment is a synonym for scope 
                          what counts is where we, the programmer, typed out the function declaration within our code.
  var                   classic way to declare a variable. 

  let/const vs var      throw an error if you try to declare the same variable a second time, var wont error will let you do

CONDITIONALS
  if                    if {}
  else                  if (age >= 18) {isAdult = true;} else {isAdult = false;}
  else if               if (age >= 21) { } else if (age >= 18) {} else if (age >= 16) {} . else not required!!!
  switch                switch (expression) { case value1: // Statements break; default: // Statements break;}
  

CLASS
  why classes?          problem is that our constructor and use of prototypes are separated from one another.
                          way to encase both the attributes and functionality produced from a constructor in one spot.
                          Instead of our User constructor function, we now have a class User.
                          Within the body of the class, we can define a special function named constructor
                          In the end, we still instantiate a new User the same way.
  class example         better than constructor alone!
                               class User {
                               constructor(name, email) {
                                 this.name = name;
                                 this.email = email;
                               }
                               sayHello() { console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);   }  //<- notice no function
                             }
                             var sarah = new User('sarah', 'sarah@gmail.com');
                             sarah.sayHello();

  CONSTRUCTOR 
    example
                            function User (name, email){      //see also prototype for adding functions from outside constructor
                              this.name = name;
                              this.email = email;
                              this.sayHello = function(){
                                console.log("Hello everybody!");
                              }
                            }
                            let susan = new User('susan', 'susan@gmail.com')
                            susan.sayHello()  // "Hello everybody!"
                            
  Inheritence
    class inheritence
                            //objects initialized from the Teacher class will inherit the same methods declared on 
                              //the User class.
                            class Teacher extends User {
                              teachMath(){          //<-----teach has this method that User does not

                        modern way of gtting data overtaking XHR
                        fetch('https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery/commits').then(res => res.json()).then(json => console.log(json)); 
                           //calling res.json() in our fetch is just a nice shorthand for saying

  XHR                   XHR (XMLHttpRequest object,)fetches data from remote resources can be used with any type of data, 
                          including JSON. helps us write dynamic programs by allowing us to fetch data from a server based on
                          user events, and update parts of pages without requiring a full-page refresh

DEBUGGING
  console.error         method is for printing out an error to the console, like console.log but prints red
  console.warn          method is for printing out an warning to the console, like console.log but prints yellow
  debugger              built-in debugging solution, and it allows us to stop our code mid-execution and poke around a bit. 
                          when at debug, we'll see this yellow banner pop up in the main browser window:
                            function something(){ debugger;}
  Testing
    End to End Test       Think of end-to-end testing like the things we'd do in the browser ourselves: 
                          'When I click this button, the card should appear in
    Integration Test      how do all the units in our program work together
    Unit testing          is testing the smallest unit possible of our program. These small units are usually single functions.
  
  
ERRORS
  hoisting errors       how to avoid
                          Declare all of your functions at the top of their scope. If the functions are declared in 
                            the global scope, simply put them at the top of the JavaScript file. 
                            If they're declared inside another function, put the declaration at the top of the function body.
                          Only use const and let. Never use var.

FUNCTION
                        see also examples at end of JS
  arrow functions       arrow functions are anonymous, All arrow functions are anonymous. 
                          This is unlike regular functions, which take their names from their identifiers.
    implicit returns 
                          ()=>{} //if no {}, gives implicit return like ruby
                          ()=>(3*3)// returns 9 || ()=>{3*3} //return is undefined   
  callbacks             the function isn't invoked immediately — instead it's called back, or invoked at a later point.
                          function main (cb) {  console.log(cb());}
                           main(function () { return "After I get passed to the main() function as the only argument, 
                                  I'm stored in the local 'cb' variable!"});
                              // LOG: After I get passed to the main() function as the only argument, I'm stored in the
                                  local 'cb' variable!
                        Because a callback function is invoked inside another function, we can forward to it any 
                          arguments passed to the outer function.
                          see examples below
   function expression  a function needs a name, but a function expression does not need one, but can have one
                          function expressions are not hoisted. 
                            sayHello();   
                            const sayHello = function () {
                              console.log('Hello');
                            };
                            // ERROR: Uncaught ReferenceError: sayHello is not defined

                            a great way to use the functions of another object without having to explicitly 
                            write them into your object.

    methods
      add               function is just a special object, we can add properties to functions and then access them:
                         const myFunc = function () {return 6 + 9;   };
                         myFunc.favoriteNumber = 42;   // => 42
                         console.log("myFunc()'s favorite number is", myFunc.favoriteNumber);
                         // LOG: myFunc()'s favorite number is 42
      apply             see call
      bind()            we need to be able to hold on to the function,add this, delay calling it until later.   
                          see for example https://repl.it/@vsparrow/Js-Object-Oriented-Bind-Call-Apply-Readme
                                  class User {
                                    constructor(name, favoriteBand){
                                      this.name = name
                                      this.favoriteBand = favoriteBand
                                    }
                                    favoriteBandMatches(bands){
                                      // here this is the User instance
                                      bands.filter(function(band){
                                        // here, this is global
                                        return band == this.favoriteBand
                                      }.bind(this))
                                    }
                                  }                          
      call              call vs apply:  only difference between call and apply is the way you pass arguments to the 
                          target function.
                              call(objectWithThis,val1,val2,etc)
                              apply(objectWithThis,[val1,val2,etc])
    pass by reference   Like all JavaScript objects, functions are passed by reference
                          When a new function is created, it's stored at a specific location in memory. 
                          When we assign a function expression to a variable, we're not actually storing the entire function 
                          in that variable — we're simply storing a reference to the location in memory where the function
                          lives If we assign the value of that first variable to a new variable, the new variable also points
                          at the same location in memory:
    promise             an object, represents a value that may not be available yet, but will be resolved at some point 
                          in the future. All promises implement a then function that is called when the promise is fulfilled,
                          or completed successfully.  So this is very similar to the idea of a callback on success
                          example: the then are promises
                            fetch('https://someapi.api.com').then(res => res.json()).then(json => console.log(json));

   reduce               two arguments, a callback function that will reduce each array element into a single, ultimate value
                          and the initial value that the reduction should start from
                        The callback function accepts four arguments:
                          The reduced total as it currently stands (or the initial value if nothing's been reduced yet).
                          The current element that's to be reduced.
                          The index of the current element within the array.

Objects
  delete
    keys                delete wednesdayMenu.salad;
  Object.assign()       which allows us to combine properties from multiple objects into a single object
                          first argument is initial object in which all of the properties are merged. 
                          Every additional argument is an object whose properties we want to merge into the first object: 
                          Object.assign({ eggs: 3 }, { flour: '1 cup' });// => { eggs: 3, flour: "1 cup" }
                          Object.assign({ eggs: 3 }, { chocolateChips: '1 cup', **flour**: '2 cups'}, {**flour**: '1/2 cup'});
                              // { eggs: 3, chocolateChips: "1 cup", ****flour: "1/2 cup"**** }   
  Object.keys()         the return value is an array containing all of the keys at the top level of the object:  
    delete key          see delete

Types
                        Everything ,except object, is a primitive, it accepts a single value
  NaN                   esentially JS going I dont know what happened                       
                        
  Numbers               No call floats, everything is a number, so is -Infinity, that is a number
                          but...everything as a double-precision floating-point number, or float                          
  Objects               collection of properties bounded by curly braces { }, similar to a hash in Ruby. 
                          The properties can point to values of any data type — even other objects:
                          typeof {} //=> "object" // {key:value} //
    null                typeof null //=> "object"                        
  Strings               'single quotes', "double quotes", or `backticks`
     
  Undefined             the variable was declared but not assigned prior to the reference.

MVC  *****************************************************************
Model View Controller
  Model         Our models do the job of interacting with the database 
  Views         Views present information to the user. 
                  Any code that is responsible for presenting data or output to the user
                    from methods that use a bunch of puts, to HTML, to ERB templates 
  Controllers   Controllers provide the main interface and application logic. 
                  What data should I show a user in response to certain input from that user"
                  represented by classes
  
  MVC Flow      user -> view ->controller -> model -> DB -> controller ->view ->user
  MVC Location  
    APP DIRECTORY       holds our MVC directories - models, views, and controllers. 
                          We spend most of our time coding in this directory.
    CONTROLLERS DIR     where the app configs, routes, and controller actions are implemented. There is typically a class,
                          in this case we will call ApplicationController, that represents an instance of your application
                          when the server is up and running. 
                          Controllers represent the application logic, generally; the interface and flow of our application.
    MODELS DIRECTORY    holds the logic behind our application. represent either a component of your application, 
                          such as a User, Post, or Comment, or a unit of work. 
                          Each file in models typically contains a different class.  
    VIEWS DIRECTORY     holds the code that will be displayed in the browser.
                          In Sinatra use .erb files instead of .html files because .erb allow us to include HTML tags 
                          AND special erb tags which contain Ruby code.
                          
                          
  Tests
    Unit tests          test the models in our application and how they interact with our database. 

    Controller tests    test that the code responsible for delivering the appropriate data to a user is working properly. 
                         In  web app,  make sure HTTP request returns the expected HTTP RESPONSE. not HTML or forms  

   Integration tests    are the highest-level test 
                          closest to describing how a user will actually interact with app. 
                          Commonly referred to as 'End-to-End' 
                          flex your entire application stack (i.e., all of the MVC components)(done with Capybara)

ORM  *****************************************************************
  AR                  SEE ALSO UPDATED AR SECTION AT TOP
  ActiveRecord:       way of doing orm through ruby using only gem. see below
  ActiveRecord       it does build out a bunch of methods for you.
                      create a database that interacts with your class with only a few lines of code.
                        creates a model, which resides in the app/models folder, model inherits from ActiveRecord::Base
                        creates a migration, which resides in the db/migrate folder.  migration inherits from ActiveRecord::Migration
                          for rails mau need to spec version: ex ActiveRecord::Migration[5.1]
  AR Association models
                      app/models/artist.rb
                        class Artist < ActiveRecord::Base
                          has_many :songs
                          has_many :genres, through: :songs
                        end
                      app/model/song.rb
                        class Song < ActiveRecord::Base
                          belongs_to :artist
                          belongs_to :genre 
                        end

                        The macros we implemented in our classes allow us to associate a song object directly to an artist object:
                          pry: hello.artist = adele
                        If you tell the parent that a certain child object has been added to its collection, 
                        both the parent and the child will know about the association. But not in reverse
                          rolling_in_the_deep = Song.new(name: "Rolling in the Deep")
                          adele.songs << rolling_in_the_deep
                          rolling_in_the_deep.artist #get adele
                          pop = Genre.create(name: "pop")
                          pop.songs << rolling_in_the_deep
                          pop.songs #rolling in deep 
                          rolling_in_the_deep.genre  #pop
                          pop.artist #adele (even though we didnt explicitly mention this

  Object Relational Mapping   the technique of accessing a relational database using an object-oriented programming language. 
                                a way for our Ruby programs to manage database data by "mapping" database tables to classes and 
                                instances of classes to rows in those tables.
                              An ORM is really just a concept. When "mapping" our program to a database, we equate classes 
                                with database tables and instances of those classes with table rows.
    Goal                      the goal of our dynamic ORM is to define a series of methods that can be shared by any class.
                                So, we need to avoid explicitly referencing table and column names.
    class to table            convention : pluralize name of class to create name of table. 
                                Therefore, the Song class equals the "songs" table.

   status codes
                        Status codes tell something to the client via 3-digit integer 
                        first digit is class of the response, and the remaining two digits represent a specific status. 
                          Status Number 	Code/Description
                          1 	1xx: Informational (request received and continuing process)
                          2 	2xx: Success (request successfully received, understood, and accepted)
                          3 	3xx: Redirection (further action must be taken to complete request)
                          4 	4xx: Client Error (request contains bad syntax and can't be completed)
                          5 	5xx: Server Error (server couldn't complete request)
                          set the response's status code by just setting the status_code attribute. By default, Rack sets a status code of 200
                            ex:
                            if req.path=="/songs"
                              resp.write "You requested the songs"

  Error and Logging
                          def update  raise params.inspect end
                            The raise method will cause the application to pause and print out the params on an error page. 
                            You could also see the params if you called puts params.inspect; using puts would simply 
                            require you to track down the data in the Rails server log.
 
  File Structure
    file and dirs

                              Notes:The data-confirm attribute and the data-method attribute rely on some JavaScript built into Rails.
                              data-method will "submit" a DELETE request as if a form had been submitted. It will use GET (the default method used by all browsers for HTML links) if the user has JavaScript disabled.
                              data-confirm pops up a confirmation window before the link is followed, allowing the user to make sure they're ready to delete someone forever (what a decision!).

    InvalidAuthenticityToken error
                            fix ActionController::InvalidAuthenticityToken error, we can integrate the form_authenticity_token helper into the form as a hidden field:
                            <input type="hidden" name="authenticity_token" value="<%= form_authenticity_token %>">
                            form_tag method also automatically generates the necessary authenticity token, so we can remove the now-redundant hidden_field_tag. 
   
    ISSUES WITH USING FORM_TAG and vs FORM_FOR
                            Our form must be manually passed to the route where the form parameters will be submitted
                            You're forced to have duplicate code throughout the form; it's hard to adhere to DRY principles
                              when utilizing the form_tag

                            form_for
                            form_for method accepts the instance of the model as an argument, is able to make a bunch of assumptions for you.
                            form_for yields an object of class FormBuilder #havent learned this yet
                            form_for auto knows route (it follows RESTful conventions) for form data as opposed to having to manually declare it
                            option to dynamically change  submit button text (this comes in very handy when you're using a form partial and the new and edit pages will share the same form

                            When use form_for and form_tag
                            form_for when your form is directly connected to a model. ex profile edit form that connects to the profile database table
                            form_tag when you simply need an HTML form generated. Examples of this would be: a search form field or a contact form

                            form_for is bound directly with the Post model, we need to pass the model name into the Active Record update method in the controller. 
                            change @post.update(title: params[:title], description: params[:description]) to:
                            @post.update(params.require(:post))
                            why do we need to require the post model? params look like this:
                            BEFORE: {"title": "My Title",  "description": "My description"}
                            NOW:    { "post": { "title": "My Title","description": "My description"}}   
                            
     Strong params          setup so that user cant change submital forms, ebcause if they do it will be denied
      to disable            config/application.rb add "config.action_controller.permit_all_parameters = true"
      problem with enable   this means is that Rails needs to be told what parameters are allowed to be submitted through 
                              the form to the database. The default is to let nothing through.
        fix                 permit fields explicitly
        #permit vs #require
                            require:params that gets passed in must contain a key called "post". If it's not included then 
                              it fail (if the key was 'post', could be 'student' etc)
                            #permit method is a bit looser. It means that the params hash may have whatever keys are in it. 
                              So in the create case, it may have the :title and :description keys. If it doesn't have one 
                              of those keys it's no problem, the hash just won't accept any other keys.
        Example:            SEE EXAMPLES BELOW  :: Look for "Strong Params + Create and update" .  
   
   GENERATE
                            rails g <name of generator> <options> --no-test-framework
                              --no-test-framework is a flag that tells the generator not to create any tests for the newly-generated models,
       types
        Migrations          create migration file
                              rails g migration add_published_status_to_posts published_status:string --no-test-framework
                              rails g migration remove_published_status_from_posts published_status:string --no-test-framework
                              rails g migration add_post_status_to_posts post_status:boolean --no-test-framework
                              rails g migration change_post_status_data_type_to_posts post_status:string --no-test-framework
                                will make migration file but wont add anything to change method
                                simply add in the change_column method like this: change_column :posts, :post_status, :string

        Models              create migration and model that will inherit from ActiveRecord::Base
                              rails g model Author name:string genre:string bio:text --no-test-framework

        Controllers
                              Controller generators are great if you are creating static views or non-CRUD related features
                              rails g controller admin dashboard stats financials settings --no-test-framework
                                controller admin_controller.rb
                                routes and views: dashboard stats financials and settings
                              ***This is a generator to be careful with – it can create a number of files that are never used  ***
                              controller generators not the best for creating CRUD based features?
                                this would create wasted code since it would create view templates for create, update, and destroy actions,
                                so they would need to be removed immediately.

        Resources
                              rails g resource Account name:string payment_status:string --no-test-framework
                                controller accounts_controller
                                model :Account
                                views: views/accounts
                              If you are building an API, using a front end MVC framework, or simply want to manually create your views,
                                the resource generator is a great option for creating the code.
                              The resource generator is a smart generator that creates some of the core functionality needed for a
                                full featured resource without much code bloat.
   HELPERS
                              Helpers are methods that are available to your views and encapsulate a common bit of code.
                                ex link_to or a text_field. We can also create out own
    organization              Helpers are generally organized by controller, ex app\helpers\application_helper.rb
                                Not restricted to a single controller, you can also use any of your own helpers in any view.
                        
                              ex: Our last_updated helper is still a Post concern (so we know to look for it in the PostsHelper), 
                                but if an author page or any other page needs to use it they can\
                              
                                  # app/helpers/posts_helper.rb
                                  module PostsHelper
                                    def last_updated(post)
                                      post.updated_at.strftime("Last updated %A, %b %e, at %l:%M %p")
                                    end
                                  end
     application helper         things that aren't the concern of a single controller and are applicable to the entire 
                                  application? For these cases, we have the application_helper
                                  ## application_helper for broader concern
                                  # app/helpers/application_helper.rb
                                  def title(text)
                                    content_for :title, text
                                  end

                                  content_for: send our text to the place in our application layout that is expecting some content for the :title

   Layouts
    default                 default layout template:        <!-- app/views/layouts/application.html.erb -->

    which layout?
      convention
                            if controller called ProductsController, it'll look for a layout at  layouts/products.html.erb
                            if controller called AdminController, it'll look for a layout at layouts/admin.html.erb
                            can't find a layout specific to controller, it'll use the default layout at 
                              app/views/layouts/application.html.erb.
                            *With the exception of the admin section of a site, most applications use the 
                              default layout for everything, so there's no need to have a layout for each controller.

                                      layout "products"

   Partials
                              View files. helps remove repeated pieces of HTML
                              an underscore is prefixed to the filename to indicate that this file is a partial
    different folder
                              referencing a partial from a different folder   ex: <%= render 'posts/form' %>
    naming                    *We could have named the partial whatever we wanted to. just start with underscore
    what to include           *even though the last line of the form (the <% end %> tag) is duplicated code, 
                                we didn't move it into the partial.
    ex
                                  <!-- app/views/posts/_form.html.erb-->
                                  <label>Post title:</label><br>

                                  <%= render 'form' %> #<- where the magic happens to pull in partial

                                  <% end %>
   
   QuickStart
                            In semi order:
                              rails new blog-flash (creates app and dirs)
                              rake db:create
                              rails s (starts server)
                              rails c (start console) Rails console loads the full Rails environment , irb doesnt
                              helper.pluralize(5, 'laptop') => 5 laptops .  test to see all working
   Routing
    "only" option           selecting which of the seven RESTful routes we care about
                              resources :posts, only: :show   |same as| get 'posts/:id', to: 'posts#show'
                              resources :posts, only: [:index, :show, :new, :create] . #for multiple
    rake routes             See routing order  priority is based upon order of creation: first created -> highest priority.
                              return of rake routes
                              posts   GET  /posts(.:format)       posts#index       #all posts
                              post    GET  /posts/:id(.:format)   posts#show        #single post
                                Column 1 - This column gives the prefix for the route helper methods ex: posts_path
                                Column 2 - This is the HTTP verb.
                                Column 3 - what the path for the route will be and what parameters need to be passed to 
                                  the route. ex post_path(@post) #you pass in instance varialbe and rails knows how get id
                                    should also just be able to pass post_path(3) for id 3
                                    ignore the (.:format) text for now.
                                Column 4 - This column shows the controller and action with a syntax of controller#action                             
    RESTful                 RESTful routes and their rails equivalents
                              Rails   RestMethod	Action	Description
                              index   GET	    /newsletters	Show all newsletters
                              create  POST	  /newsletters	Create a new newsletter
                              new     GET	    /newsletters/new	Render the form for creating a new newsletter
                              edit    GET	    /newsletters/:id/edit	Render the form for editing a newsletter
                              show    GET	    /newsletters/:id	Show a single newsletter
                              update  PATCH	  /newsletters/:id	Update a newsletter
                              destroy DELETE	/newsletters/:id	Delete a newsletter
                                see http://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html  
    route helpers             Route helpers are more dynamic since they are methods and not simply strings. 
                                use with view and controller (not model)
      change name             get '/register', to: 'users#new', as: 'register' #disaply /users/new  as /register                                                    
      helper vs hardcode      post_path(post, opt_in: true) is more readable than "posts/<%= post.id %>?opt_in=true"   


    SESSIONS-------------------------------
      Controller Sessions
        OVERVIEW
                              siimplest possible login system 
                                The user GETs /login
                                The user enters their username. There is no password.
                                The user submits the form, POSTing to /login.
                                In the create action of the SessionsController we set a cookie on the user's browser 
                                  by writing their username into the session hash.
                                Thereafter, the user is logged in. session[:username] will hold their username.

                              SessionsController to handle  routes.
                               two actions, new and create, which we'll map in routes.rb to get and post on /login.
                               Our sessions controller is just going to trust that you are who you say you are.  
          ex controller setup 
                             class SessionsController < ApplicationController
                                def new
                                    # nothing to do here!
                                end 
                                def create
                                    session[:username] = params[:username]
                                    redirect_to '/'
                                end
                                def destroy   #logout
                                  session.delete :username
                                end
                                #The most common way to route this action is to post '/logout'
                                #don't attach this to a get route. HTTP specifies that get routes don't change anything
                              end#class
          ex form setup
                            We'll make a very small login form for new.html.erb, #Ordinarily, we would use form_for @user,
                              but in this example, we don't have a user model at all!
                            form method='post'>
                              <input name='username'>
                              <input type='submit' value='login'>
                            </form>        
      
      Cookies                 server ask browser to store data for it, and then get that data back from the browser later.
        session
                              session method is available anywhere in the Rails response cycle, and it behaves like a hash:
                              # set cart_id
                              session[:cart_id] = @cart.id
                              # load the cart referenced in the session
                              @cart = session[:cart_id]
          session key
                              <--config/secrets.yml-->
                              development:
                                secret_key_base: kaleisgreat  # probably not the most secure key ever

                              Somewhere else, Rails has a method, let's call it sign, which takes a message and a key and
                                returns a signature, which is just a string:
                                # sign(message: string, key: string) -> signature: string
                                def sign(message, key):
                                  # cryptographic magic here
                                  return signature
                                end #It's guaranteed that given the same message and key, sign will produce the same output

        view cookie:          chrome : Resources > Cookies # try Inspect:Application:Cookies
        Why use ?             HTTP servers are typically stateless. They receive requests, process them, return data,
                                then forget about them.

        ex                    #This way, we can use current_cart in our views and layouts too
                                  items_controller.rb
                                  # Routed from POST /items/:id/add_to_cart
                                  def add_to_cart #which is called when the user adds something to their cart.
                                    # Get the item from the path
                                    @item = Item.find(params[:id])
                                    # Load the cart from the session, or create a new empty cart.
                                    current_cart << @item.id
                                  end

                                  class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
                                    helper_method :current_cart
                                    def current_cart
                                      session[:cart] ||= []
                                    end
                                  end
      Login
        Login Required            documents should only be shown to users when they're logged in
        Login required for action       if a user isn't logged in, we return 403 Forbidden.
          example DRY SOLUTION
                                  class DocumentsController < ApplicationController
                                    before_action :require_login    
                                      #before_action registers a filter. 
                                    skip_before_action :require_login, only: [:index] 
                                      #skip require_login for actions we want everyone to see
                                      # A filter is a method which runs before, after, or around, a controller's action.  
                                    def show
                                      @document = Document.find(params[:id])
                                    end
                                    def index
                                    end
                                    def create
                                      @document = Document.create(author_id: user_id)
                                    end
                                    private
                                    def require_login
                                      return head(:forbidden) unless session.include? :user_id    
                                    end
                                  end  
          example for single
                                 def show #, 
                                   return head(:forbidden) unless session.include? :user_id
                                   @document = Document.find(params[:id])
                                 end  
        
        What happens at login?    what does it actually mean for a user to log in
                                    when a user logs in all we are doing is using cookies to add their 
                                      :user_id to their session

    VALIDATIONS
      validations
                              special method calls that go at the top of model class definitions and prevent them from being 
                                saved to the database if their data doesn't look right. AR validate is not DB validate
                                http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_validations.html
      new vs create
                              The only way to trigger validation without touching the database is to call the #valid? method.
                                create forces db validate, new unles valid? is call will not validate

      validation failure      default AR returns false not raise error on invalid
        error messages        look at the model's #errors object. p.errors.messages #=> name: can't be blank
                                check one attribute at a time by passing the name to errors as a key person.errors[:age]
       raise exception        Every database method has a sister method with a ! at the end which will raise an exception  
                                like create!
       
      validators (other than valid?)
        length                validates :name, length: { minimum: 2 } #{ maximum: 500 }#{ in: 6..20 }#{ is: 6 }

    views mapping
      Explicit rendering    Rails lets you dictate which view file you want to have the controller action mapped to.
      Implicit rendering    follows convention automatically look for view file with same name as the controller action.

    Example                 Static
                              adding route ::  in config/routes.rb draw block
                                get 'about', to: 'static#about'  #get url route about this route should be passed through
                                the static controller's about action (ie: method in a controller)
                              adding a new file to the application: app/controllers/static_controller.rb
                                class StaticController < ApplicationController
                                  def about
                                    # render "some_page" #will look for /views/static/some_page.html.erb 
                                    #if render commented out rails will look for /views/static/about.html.erb by convention
                                  end #best practice not use explicit dir name
                                end
                            Dynamic
                              WANT to get to /posts/:id . 222 is passed in app should render data for the post ID of 222
                              ROUTE  # in config/routes.rb draw
                                resources :posts, only: :show . || same as || get 'posts/:id', to: 'posts#show'

                                      def create

                                    Since we have defined this setter ourselves, Post.create does not try to fall back to setting category_name
                                     through Active Record. You can think of #category_name= as intercepting the call to the database

RAKE *****************************************************************
rake                    like bash for ruby. does presetup or maintenntece work like setup db, reset files etc
rake console

                          end
rake db:migrate         if Student class has a #create_table method, we use that method to build out our own migrate
                          namespace task under the db heading.  it will contain a few common database-related tasks.
                          call task migrate, convention to say we  "migrating" db by applying SQL statements 
                            that alter that database.
                              namespace :db do

                          (which is where the student class and database are loaded), we need to give our task access 
                          to this file. In order to do that, we need to define yet another 
                          Rake task that we can tell to run before the migrate task is run. 
                              task :environment do                      #add this for successfull db migratiion

                            desc 'outputs hola to the terminal'
                            task :hola do 
                              puts "hola de Rake!"
                            end
                          end #namespace
                        how to call : rake greeting:hello . ## what you get back :: hello from Rake!
                        how to call : rake greeting:hola. ## what you get back :: hola de Rake!

Now, to use either of our Rake tasks, we use the following syntax:

rake greeting:hello
hello from Rake!

rake greeting:hola
hola de Rake!
REACT ****************************************************************

  REACT

                              ReactComponents are stateful. but they have no access to the virtual DOM
                              ReactElement is not stateful
                              react gives you consistency : good for reading other people code / debug
                              good for something with lot of dom updates, not good at small lightweight
                              react is a library written in/for js
    arrow functions           arrow function maintains the execution context it was defined with
                                that is why we use it in react to maintain state        
                                Alternative
                                  construct(){super();this.timesClicked = this.timesClicked.bind(this)}   //arrow is easier
                               
                              Your HTML-like blocks returned from render method can have a state.
    component                 split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation.
      functional
                              functional component  (different from class component)
                                const COmmentList= (props)=>{
                                  console.log(props)  //not this.props , isnt a class component
                                  return (      <div>Comment</div>    )  }      
      export                  export component
                                The reason we are exporting them here is so that our testing suite will have access to them.
    create app                create-react-app nameoffolder, likes rails new\
                                npm install -g yarn   //yarn wrapper for npm, except it caches unlike npm
                                index.js    render app, index is mostly for  config
                                registerserviceworker : for progressive web apps: not for us.
                                error jsx not defined   you didnt import react into file
    events:
      event attribute         event.target.getAttribute("data-sortorder") //or any attribute that you added to the html jsx
      event.target            get the target of an event
      event.preventDefault()  prevent a default action
      persist event pool      store the data you need in a variable (e.g. const target = event.target),
                                or  make the event persistent by calling that method: event.persist()
    Forms aka controlled component
                              To control the value of these inputs, we use a prop specific to that type of input:
                                For <input> and <textarea>, we use value
                                For <input type="checkbox"> and <input type="radio">, we use checked
                                For <option>, we use selected
                              To listen for changes to the value of an input, we simply pass in the onChange prop 
                                with a callback function.    
    Imperative vs Declarative
                              imperative:
                                const people = ['Amanda', 'Geoff', 'Michael', 'Richard', 'Ryan', 'Tyler']
                                const excitedPeople = []
                                for (let i = 0; i < people.length; i++) {  excitedPeople[i] = people[i] + '!'}
                              declarative
                                const people = ['Amanda', 'Geoff', 'Michael', 'Richard', 'Ryan', 'Tyler']
                                const excitedPeople = people.map(name => name + '!')  
    Import react             
                              import React from 'react';    //React:variable react:packagename
                              import ReactDOM from 'react'; //ReactDOM:variable react:packagename    
    Installation              npm install --save react react-dom  || yarn add react react-dom //both commands work
    PROPS                     Props allow us to pass values into our components., props move down, state can move up
    PropTypes
                              
                              PropTypes is a way for us to enforce that components receive the right props in the right form
                                These warnings only show up in development versions of React — 
                                this stuff isn't checked in production
     PropTypes install        npm install prop-types
                                add the PropTypes node package to our node_modules folder so that we can access PropTypes:
     propTypes reference      https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/reusable-components.html#prop-validation   
    Render
                              ReactDOM.render() //takes 2 arguments, 1) a component, 2) a place to place the component
                              example:
                                ReactDOM.render(
                                  React.createElement("h2",{},"hello")  //element,props,children (single child here)
                                  React.createElement("div",{},[        //element,props,children (multi child here)
                                    React.createElement("h2",{},"hello")
                                    React.createElement("p",{},"Nice to meet you!")

  BABEL
                              npm start
                                to complete the Babel compiling, Webpack bundling, process.
                              npm run watch
                                will initiate 'hot reloading', which re-pushes your application to the browser anytime you 
                                save files you are working on.


   Webpack 
                              webpack always calls babel.
                              dev calls webpack, so server calls webpack, not the file or user end rbowser

   JSX ///////////////////
    React JSX example
                              A React component written in JSX looks something like this:
                              class Tweet extends React.Component {
                                render() {
                                  return (
                                    <div className="tweet">
                                      <img src="http://twitter.com/some-avatar.png" className="tweet__avatar" />
                                      <div className="tweet__body">
                                          <p>We are writing this tweet in JSX. Holy moly!</p>
                                      </div>
                                    </div>
                                  );
                                }
                              }

  JSX RESERVE CLASS WORDS
                    If you want to use the HTML for attribute, you'd use htmlFor instead.
                    HTML classes using the className attribute (or prop, in React terms), instead of class

  JSX CHILDREN
                    JSX always has one, and only one element 
                      (that optionally has children, grandchildren, and so on).
                    BAD!!!! CANT DO This
                      return (
                        <p>I am the first paragraph</p>
                        <p>I am the second paragraph</p>
                      );
                    CAN DO THIS
                      return (
                        <div>
                          <p>I am the first paragraph</p>
                          <p>I am the second paragraph</p>
                        </div>
                      );
                    WHICH IS THE SAME AS
                      return React.createElement(
                        "div",
                        null,
                        React.createElement(
                          "p",
                          null,
                          "I am the first paragraph"
                        ),
                        React.createElement(
                          "p",
                          null,

                      );

RUBY *****************************************************************
ARGUMENTS
              calling methods with parentheses, e.g., greeting('Sophie'). 
                But you can also omit the parentheses: greeting 'Sophie'.
                see also "Hash arguments"
  default/optional    (name = "Ruby programmer"), we simply assign the argument name a default value of "Ruby programmer" 
  hash arguments      aka keyword arguments
                      WHY USE? 
                      If a required keyword argument is missing, Ruby will raise a useful ArgumentError 
                        that tells us which required argument we must include. Dont need read code body
                              #Student.create("Sally","10th")
                              def self.create(name:, grade:)
                                puts "************#{name} #{grade}"   #get .************Sally 10th
                              end #create
  required+optional   def greeting(name, language="Ruby") # required MUST come before optional
  SPLAT       
    splat   *, can be used to convert an array into a list of arguments
             def add(a,b) ;  a + b ;  end  ; pair = [3,7] ;  add *pair #here pair is sent in as 3 and 7 not [3,7]
    multiple assignments
            first, *list = [1,2,3,4]          # first= 1, list= [2,3,4]
            *list, last  = [1,2,3,4]          # list= [1,2,3], last= 4
            first, *center, last = [1,2,3,4]  # first= 1, center= [2,3], last=4

            a = *"Hello"  #=> ["Hello"]  #usues array coersion. see below cannot use .to_a so use this
            "Hello".to_a  #=> NoMethodError: undefined method `to_a' for "Hello":String
            a = *(1..3)   #=> [1, 2, 3]
            a = *[1,2,3]  #=> [1, 2, 3]  

CLASS
  class variable  @@all     accessible to all in class              
  constant        ALL= [] normally unchanging or rarely
  Constructor     instantiate and save. (so the method def self.create /n song=self.new /n song.save end is a constructor
                    good for things like Artist.new_from_url who call constructor to create and save .
  instantiate     make new instance of
  
  Class MODULES     it is not inheritence , ie: using < because we jsut give access to methods, doesnt ean type of something
                    Bmw < Car, bmw is a type of car # . Bmw::SpeedStuff means Bmw gives methods access without saying
                      bme is type of speedtuff
                        class Dancer
                          extend FancyDance::ClassMethods             extend classs methods
                          include FancyDance::InstanceMethods         include instance methods
                        end
  Modules
    class methods     we "extend" classmethods   extend FancyDance::ClassMethods 
                        module Memorable  module ClassMethods  def count  /n self.all.count /n end#count  end#ClassMethods  end#Memorable 
                        class Artist   extend Memorable::ClassMethods  end #artist.  now you can call self.count even though its called count
                            because it is a class method 
    initialize        place it in instance method below.
                        what if there is extra things a particular class needs it's initialie to do? see Super
    instance methods  we "include" instance methods.  same as above without hte self needed to call count. 
    <ClassName>.all     for DRY instance methods use <ClassName>.all to replace specifc items like @@all from init
                        example: def init <ClassName>.all =[] end 
                          we can call self.class.all inside .initialize and it will be just as if we called Song.all or Artist.all
    Super             A method that includes the super keyword will execute any code placed inside the super class' method 
                        of the same name, and then execute any code inside the child class' method.
                          def initialize /n super /n @songs = [] /n end .  in Artists class
                          def initialize /n self.class.all << self /n end . in module
                        
                        
CONFIGURATION   config/environment.rb in run files require only this , instead of each and every file from the lib directory. 
                  As we start to build larger and more complex programs, handle all of our requirements in one place.

DEBUGGING
  errors       see ERRORS below
  pry          gem install pry
               require "pry" on top of code 
               use the following line "binding.pry" anywhere in your code.
                When the interpreter hits that line, your program will actually freeze and your terminal 
                  will turn into a REPL(interpreter like irb)
  .to_stdout   method works by temporarily replacing the $stdout variable.                   


ERRORS
  custom errors           To build a custom error, we define an error class that inherits from the Exception class. 
                            usually inherit from StandardError. Lookup "error class inheritance" for more 
                            ex: class SomeClassName < StandardError end
                                if person.class != Person raise PartnerError 
                            on error: custom_errors.rb:11:in `get_married': Person::PartnerError (Person::PartnerError)
                            with above example: program WONT continue to run. see RESCUE to continue program
  custom messages         use custom errors above, but place message in class for customer message
                            class PartnerError < StandardError
                              def message 
                                "you must give the get_married method an argument of an instance of the person class!"
                              end
                            end  
  rescue program          custom error causes program to stop. use above custom message and rescue to continue program
                              begin
                                raise PartnerError
                              rescue PartnerError => error
                                  puts error.message
                              end

  
FILES  
  !           "shebang line" and it tells the shell which interpreter to use to execute the remainder of the file.
                #!/usr/bin/env ruby  Any executable files we place in our bin directory need to begin with the line
                you can execute your program by typing bin/< your file name > into the command line, 
                  since the shebang line at the top of your executable file is already telling the shell to use Ruby 
                  

LOOPS
  .each       see Types.Array.each
  for         for counter in 1..40 do   /n    puts "The current number is #{counter}."  /nend

METHODS
  block           a simple form of a closure in Ruby. Blocks are constructed with a do...end or with {}.
  block_given?    method to optionally take block           if block_given? X else Y end
  closure         block of functional code with variables that are bound to the environment that the closure is called in.
                    it can be passed around like an object 
                    can be defined in one scope and be called in a completely different scope,
                    it remembers the variables within its scope at the time of creation; 
                      when it's called, it can access those variables even if they might not be in that current scope
  helper          smaller methods, each of which is responsible for one discrete unit of the game.
  lambda          isn't that much different than a proc in functionality. The & before it turns it into a block,
                   plus_one = lambda { |n| puts n + 1 }; array = [1, 2, 3] ; array.each(&plus_one)
                   ALTERNATE decleration :: plus_one = ->(n) { puts n + 1 }
                  Proc vs Lambda 
                    lambdas check for arguments ; procs just returns nil for the missing argument, but do not throw an error                    they return differently: lambdas return to the calling method and 
                      procs return immediately without going back to the caller—essentially,
                      lambdas behave more like method calls: you can think of them as anonymous functions
                    flow control differences proc vs lambda : the return and break keyword  are treated is the difference 
                      return from proc returns from wrapping method, lamnda woud just continue
                        see https://www.skorks.com/2010/05/ruby-procs-and-lambdas-and-the-difference-between-them/
  proc            is a block turned into an object by being assigned to an instance of the Proc class.
                    Procs are a type of closure , can be assigned to a local variable,
                    is executed by calling the call method on it,  more than one proc can be passed to a method. 
                    greeting = Proc.new { "Hello!" } ; greeting.call => "Hello!"
                  see also lambda
  wrapper/runner  a boss method 
                    ex To run our program, we need to call several  methods. 
                    Instead of calling each of them in turn, we might place them inside a single method. 
                    Then, to enact our program, we only have to invoke our one wrapper, or runner method
  yield           Stop executing the code in this method, and instead execute the code in this block. 
                    Then, return to the code in the method."  
                  if give it an argument, it will pass that argument to the block and 
                    that data will become available to the code in the block.

OPERATORS/OPERATIONS

TYPES
  Array
  range       see below 
  .any?       return true if the code in the block evaluates to true for any element in the collection. 
  .collect    see .map
  .delete     Deletes items from self that are equal to obj. If any items are found, returns obj.
  .delete_at  Deletes the element at the specified index, returning that element,  
  .delete_if  delete from the collection any items that return true for a certain condition:
  .detect     similar to .find except Detect returns the first item in the list for which the block returns TRUE 
  .each       iterate over array CHANGES ARRAY!  see .map for non change
  .each_with_index    interate with an index included
  find        see .index()    
  .first
  .flatten    Returns a new array that is a one-dimensional flattening of this array (recursively) [1,[2,3]] => [1,2,3]
  .INCLUDE?   does contain?
  .index()    argument inside the parentheses will return the first index number of an element matching that argument.
                famous_cats.index("Puss in Boots") => 1    # famous_cats = ["Cheshire Cat", "Puss in Boots", "Garfield"]
                see .select for ALL the elements
  .insert     letters.insert(-1, 'd')   #insert d into last position   
  .inspect    returns a string containing a human-readable representation of an object.
  .last
  .map        similar to .each except a new array or hash object is returned, not the original one.
  .pop(2)     can use pop to remove more than one item!!!!!!!!
  .sample     get a random value from array
  .select     returns a new collection containing of  elements in the submitted collection for which
                the block's conditional is true
  .shift(2)   can shift more than one item!!!
  .size       like .length
  .sort       return new array. use sort! to affect current arr
                "spaceship operator" (<=>). The spaceship operator, also called the combined comparison operator
                array.sort do |a, b| /n   a <=> b    /n end; a==b return 0; a<b return -1; a>b return 1
  .reverse
  .uniq       remove duplicate items
  other enumberables    http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.2/Enumerable.html
  

  Bool        0 1   true false
    truthy    only nil and false are falsey.   0 is "truthy"
    double-bang operator 
              (!!) will return true or false based on whether a value is truthy or falsey to begin with.

  Hash
        See also SYMBOLS below
        store objects differ from arrays in that they function like dictionaries. 
        hashes are composed of key/value pairs. Each key points to a specific value
          ––just like a word and a definition in a regular dictionary.
          {"i'm a key" => "i'm a value!", "key2" => "value2"}
        Hashes allow us to store named, or associated, data. Think of a dictionary or an address book.  
    =>       symbol, known for this use as the "hash-rocket" (because it looks like a little rocket               
    adding   hashes use the "bracket-equals" method to add data. #hash["new_key"] = "New Value"
              person = { "name" => "Corinna",  "age" => 36} ; person["hometown"] = "Massena, NY"


  Numbers   
          Fixnums are whole numbers, like 7.
          Floats are decimal numbers, like 7.3.
  .ceil     7.5.ceil  => 8
  .floor    7.5.floor   => this method will round the float down to the nearest fixnum. Here it will return 7
   MAth     http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/Math.html  
              functions like sqrt
  .next     10.next => 11
  
  Range     a set of values with a beginning and an end. A range can contain strings or integers.
            A range of strings: ("a", "b", "c", "d") A range of integers: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)
            A range can be constructed using this notation: (100..200) Or this notation: (100...200)
            .. ("double-dot") includes the second number (200) in the range, while using a ... ("triple-dot") excludes it.
            Ranges can be helpful when you are generating arrays which we will be learning more about soon.
    .to_a   method, when called on a range, can convert a range of numbers to an array:
              (1..10).to_a   => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
  
  Strings
   array      a = *"Hello"  #=> ["Hello"]  # see RUBY ARGUMENTS SPLAT for more   
  .class      get class of any item.    "hello".class
   heredoc    create a string that runs on to multiple lines. To create a heredoc, we use:
                <<- + name of language contained in our multiline statement + the string, on multiple lines + name of language.
                You don't have to use a heredoc, it's just a helpful tool for crafting long strings  
  .join
  .reverse    "hello".reverse    => "olleh"
  .size       "hello".size    => 5
  .split
  .start_with?  
  .swapcase   "hELLO".swapcase  => "Hello"
  .upcase     "hello".upcase  => "HELLO"

  Symbol
            symbol is a representation of a piece of data. Symbols look like this :my_symbol. 
            If I make a symbol, :my_symbol, and then use that symbol later on in my code,
                my program will refer to the same area of memory in both cases.

    RUBY DOCS http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.2/Hash.html

VARIABLES   variables   words or characters that hold values
            don’t hold object values. str doesn’t contain “Hello”. Rather, str contains a reference to a string object. 
              It’s the string object that has the characteristic of containing the letters that make up “Hello”.
  constant    written in UPPERCASE or Capitalized. They have a global scope when defined globally, 
                and local scope when defined within classes and modules. 
                Constants cannot be defined within methods. When constants are initialized, they should not be reassigned.               
                cannot start with a number, be a Ruby reserved word, or have punctuation or space characters.
  Global variables  "global scope". accessed anywhere in a program and are declared with a dollar sign in front   
                      $global_variable
  Local variables   "local scope", meaning that their definitions remain where they are declared.
                      If we define a variable within a method definition, only the method knows about that variable                
  pass-by-value  A variable makes a copy of the value it holds and passes the copy over to something else that 
                  alters or changes it.   
                  ex "hello".upcase
                  Primitive data like integers, floats, fixnums, and symbols require a fixed, small amount of memory. 
                    therefor pass by value                    
  pass-by-reference. changes to a variable would alter what is stored in the actual location it refers to.
                After the process was complete the variable would be holding a new and different value.
                ex x=5                
                 Objects that can grow and change, like arrays and strings, are never a fixed size. 
                  They are instead always accessed by a reference pointer
  range       see RUBY->TYPES
  type        the type of the value a var holds. Ruby is what is known as a dynamically typed language. 
                means the value of a variable can change its type and does not need to be explicitly/permanently defined. 



RSPEC ***************************************************************
  A test is always going to be about setting up a state with a known result and 
  comparing that known result or expectation to the behavior of your program, 
  thus ensuring that your program behaves as you expected.  

ERROR TYPES
  ARGUMENT ERRORS   occur when methods are passed either too few or too many arguments.
  NAME ERRORS       NameErrors are caused when a given name is invalid or undefined
  NO METHOD ERRORS  no method for something
                      will often occur when you have a variable set to nil
  Syntax errors     they're the result of incorrect syntax.
  TYPEERRORS        When you try and do a mathematical operation on two objects of a different type,


Structure
  require_relative '../a.rb'  #loads the code from our actual program file 
  describe "something" do     #we use the describe RSpec method and strings to describe what we are testing. 
                  This code is entirely for you, the programmer, and has very little meaning to RSpec or Ruby.
  it "returns something" do   #to state an expectation or behavior of that method.       
      "" is only there to provide you, the programmer, with a description of what behavior we're currently testing.
      #what is inside the "it do end" block is what we actually test      
  expect(age_of_person).to eq(19)   #expect var to equal value
  Stubbing        refers to the fake implementation of a method.

paths
  absolute path 
    points to the same location  regardless of the working directory. They start with / ("forward slash") 
    because that is the root of your file system. This is an absolute path: /Users/avi.
  relative path 
    path relative to the working directory of the user or application, 
    They start with the name of a directory or a file.This is a relative path: avi/Documents.
$PATH  list of directories that BASH will look in for commands, scripts, and programs.  type into shell
    edit .bash_profile to add/remove dirs
pipe    | symbol named "pipe", will send the output of one command into the input of another command.

SINATRA *****************************************************************

 sinatra                 get access to methods like: get and post
  ActiveRecord           see ActiveRecord for sinatra and active record
  cookies                see session below
  install                First, make sure Sinatra is installed by running gem install sinatra in your terminal.
  controllers 
    multiple             to use multiple you need the following lines in config.ru
                          require 'sinatra'
                          require_relative 'app/controllers/products_controller'  #controller 1
                          require_relative 'app/controllers/orders_controller'    #controller 2
                          use ProductsController  #Only one class can be specified to be run
                          run OrdersController    #The other class must be loaded as Middleware. simply use instead of run.
  
  Sinatra CRUD  
                          Create: Model.create
                          Read: Model.all/Model.find(id_number)
                          Update: Model.update
                          Delete: Model.destroy
     create                "create" implemented by building a route/controller action, to render the form for creating 
                            a new instance of your model.
                            get '/model/new' -> new.erb -> form sends a POST request to controller action, post '/models'
                            extracts form data from params and uses it to create a new instance of your model class, 
                            something along the lines of Model.create(some_attribute: params[:some_attribute]).
      read                two ways which we can read data.  all of the instances of a class, or a specific instance of a class.
                            '/models' controller instance variable: @models = Model.all. then renders the index.erb view page
                             index.erb view page will use erb to render all of the instances stored in the @models instance variable.
                             OR
                             get '/models/:id' controller  example, user types in www.yourwebsite.com/models/2, 
                             this route will catch that request and get the id number, in this case 2, from the params. 
                             then find the instance of the model with that id number/set it equal to an instance variable:
                             @model = Model.find(params[:id]). Finally, it will render the show.erb view page.
                             The show.erb view page will use erb to render the @model object.
      update              controller action that renders an update form, and we need a controller action to catch the post 
                            request sent by that form.
                            get 'models/:id/edit' controller action will render the edit.erb view page.
                            edit.erb contain form for editing a given instance of a model. form will send a PATCH request 
                              to patch '/models/:id'.
                            patch '/models/:id' controller action will find the instance of the model to update, using the id
                              from params, update and save that instance.
      update(config.ru)
                            in file config.ru:   use Rack::MethodOverride /n run ApplicationController
                             add a line to your form.
                             <form action="/models/<%= @model.id %>" method="post">
                                <input id="hidden" type="hidden" name="_method" value="patch">
                                <input type="text" ...>
                            </form>
                            MethodOverride middleware will intercept every request sent and received by our application. 
                              If it finds a request with name="_method", it will set the request type based on what is set 
                              in the value attribute, which in this case is patch.
      delete                doesn't get its own view page but is implemented via a "delete button" on the show page of a 
                              given instance. his "delete button", however, isn't really a button; it's a form! 
                              The form should send a DELETE request to delete '/models/:id/delete' 
                              contain only a "submit" button with a value of "delete". That way, appear as only a button
                              <form method="post" action="/models/<%= @model.id %>/delete">
                                <input id="hidden" type="hidden" name="_method" value="DELETE">
                                <input type="submit" value="delete">
                              </form> . #The hidden input field is important to note here.

                            The class name we defined in our application controller (app.rb) is just a normal Ruby class. 
                            We could have named it MyToDoApp rather than Application  
                            If this was our class name, we would need to change config.ru to run the appropriate class: run MyToDoApp

  forms                   #SEE ALSO ERB:HASHES:FORMS
                          to connect the form to our application, give it explicit directions on where and how 
                            to send the data from the user. Both of these pieces of data are attributes that we give  <form>                            
                          <form method="POST" action="/food">
                            method  tells the form what kind of request should be fired to the server
                            action  tells the form what specific route the post request should be 
                          The name attribute of an <input> defines how our app  identify each <input> data.
                          we'll set up a post route: in app.rb
                            post '/food' do
                              # params.to_s #get{"name"=>"Sam", "favorite_food"=>"Green Eggs and Ham"}
                              "My name is #{params[:name]}, and I love #{params[:favorite_food]}"
                            end  
  
  session                 a hash that stores data on the server and passes that data to the client as a cookie. 
    access                access the data stored in the session in the same way you would any hash in Ruby.
    clear                 session.clear in a controller call this to clear the hash. ex: 
                            get '/logout' do 
                              session.clear 
                              "Session has now been cleared. session content: #{session.inspect}"
                            end
    enable                enable sessions within the controller (e.g., app.rb) by adding two lines in the configure block:
                            configure do
                              enable :sessions
                              set :session_secret, "secret" #ncryption key that will be used to create a session_id
                            end

    session example
                            @session = {
                              "session_id"=>  
                                "dd32f512ee239ad74aa6f10c8cad37ce28d6c6922eff252ed641b1017130fe22", 
                              "csrf"=> "040e9777d4dfae03bb1e6498f2a75482", 
                              "tracking"=>{

                            }
    session hash           to keep track of a current user throughout a session, we need to set up the session hash to store
                            the user_id in the hash during a controller action. 
                            Since we haven't covered logins and logouts, use the session hash to store the user's name:
                              get '/hey' do 
                                 @session = session
                               end
                             WHEN enabled sessions in our app, every controller action has access to the session hash.
                             store session hash in the instance variable @session so that views will have access to 
                              the session data. 
     session hash modify    modify and add data to the session hash by adding a key-value pair:
                                  get '/hey' do 
                                    session["name"] = "Victoria"
                                    @session = session
                                  end                         
    session_id            string of letters/numbers that is unique to a user's session and is stored in the browser cookie
    

  variables
   EVLUATE VARIABLES      <%= %> . what ever in here is display to user:  <% %> this is used to evaluate but not display
                             example: <% @friends.each do |friend|%>  <h2><%= friend %></h2> <% end%> 
                             each evaluates friendS but is not display. but frienD is displayed to user 
   InStance Variables     Instance variables are ONLY passed from the controller method where they are created to the view 
                            that is rendered, not between controller methods.
                            post '/reverse' do
                              original_string = params["string"]
                              @reversed_string = original_string.reverse
                              erb :reversed
                            end
                            We can now access the contents of @reversed_string inside of our view, reversed.erb.
                            in reversed.erb USE:  <h2><%= @reversed_string %></h2> 
  yeild
                            In layout.erb, add a yield wherever we want the other page to be loaded:
                              Let's say we have a controller action:
                                get '/' do 
                                  erb :index 
                                end
                              When the controller action is triggered and erb method is called, it looks to see if there is a 
                              view titled layout.erb. If that file exists, it loads that content around the desired erb file, 
                              in this case index.erb. review: https://github.com/learn-co-students/sinatra-yield-readme-v-000
  
  Modular Sinatra Pattern 
                          Sinatra is more commonly used through the MSP (over the classical, single file app.rb pattern).
  Shotgun                 small Ruby gem that makes it easier to develop and test Rack-based Ruby web applications locally
                            by starting Rack with automatic code reloading.
                            When start app with shotgun, all of your app code will be reloaded upon every browser connection
    install               gem install shotgun

                              The GROUP BY() keyword is very similar to ORDER BY(). The only difference is that 
                                ORDER BY() sorts the resulting data set of basic queries while 
                                GROUP BY() sorts the result sets of aggregate functions.
                                group by examples:: https://learn.co/tracks/full-stack-community-bootcamp/sql-structured-query-language/table-relations/grouping-and-sorting-data
     multiple column        SELECT breed, owner_id, COUNT(breed) FROM cats GROUP BY breed, owner_id;
      
    limit                   LIMIT is used to determine the number of records you want to return from a dataset
                              SELECT * FROM cats ORDER BY age DESC LIMIT 1; returns just the first, i.e. oldest, cat on list.
    order_by                his modifier allows us to order the table rows returned by a certain SELECT statement.
                              SELECT column_name FROM table_name ORDER BY column_name ASC|DESC;
      multiple column         SELECT col_name, col_name FROM table_name ORDER BY col_name ASC|DESC, col_name ASC|DESC;
                              SELECT * FROM cats ORDER BY age;

    aggregate functions     functions perform a calculation on specified values, queried from a database table.                        
      select count          the number of records that meet certain condition      
                             "SELECT COUNT([column name]) FROM [table name] WHERE [column name] = [value]"
                              SELECT COUNT(owner_id) FROM cats WHERE owner_id = 1;
                              SELECT COUNT(*) FROM cats WHERE net_worth > 1000000; #get count of cats with > $1,000,000
      select average       SELECT AVG(column_name) FROM table_name;
                              SELECT AVG(net_worth) FROM cats;

      having                having is the aggegate equivalent of WHERE. WHERE will not work with aggregates.

 Relationships - Table relations
  child                     The thing that "belongs to" we'll call the child.  #see also parent
  foriegn key               child gets foreign key column, the value of which is the primary key of that data's/row's parent.
  JOIN                      way to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a common column between them.
                              DIAGRAMs of Joins: https://learn.co/tracks/full-stack-community-bootcamp/sql-structured-query-language/table-relations/sql-complex-joins
                                advanced example:
                                  SELECT column(s)
                                  FROM table_one
                                  INNER JOIN table_two
                                  ON table_one.column_name = table_two.column_name
                                  WHERE table_two.column_name = condition;
    Complex Join            refers to outer joins (right outer join and left outer join and full outer join)                            
    FULL JOIN	              Returns all rows when there is a match in ONE of the tables 
                               SQLite doesn't currently support RIGHT OUTER JOINs or FULL OUTER JOINs #postgress does
                                combine the result of both a LEFT and RIGHT OUTER JOIN. In other words, they will return 
                                  all the data from both the first and second tables.
                              SELECT column_name(s) FROM first_table
                                FULL OUTER JOIN second_table ON first_table.column_name = second_table.column_name;      
    INNER JOIN	            Returns all rows when there is at least one match in BOTH tables
                              SELECT column_name(s) FROM first_table 
                                INNER JOIN second_table ON first_table.column_name = second_table.column_name;
    LEFT JOIN	              Returns all rows from the left table, and the matched rows from the right table
                              meaning returns all rows from the left, or first, table, regardless of whether or not they met 
                                the JOIN condition. The query will also return the matched data from the right, or second,
                                table.
                              SELECT column_name(s) FROM first_table LEFT JOIN second_table
                                ON first_table.column_name=second_table.column_name;
    RIGHT JOIN	            Returns all rows from the right table, and the matched rows from the left table
                               SQLite doesn't currently support RIGHT OUTER JOINs or FULL OUTER JOINs #postgress does
                                return all data from the right, or second, table and the matched data from the left/first table.
                                SELECT column_name(s) FROM first_table
                                  RIGHT JOIN second_table ON first_table.column_name = second_table.column_name;

TESTING ********************************************************************************************  

  Testing
                          three types of tests:
                            Models (RSpec)
                            Controllers (RSpec)
                            Features (RSpec/Capybara)
  CAPYBARA                (Feature tests are traditionally located in spec/features)
                            gem 'capybara'
                            require 'capybara/rails' #Then set up Capybara-Rails integration in spec/rails_helper.rb:
                            require 'capybara/rspec' #Then set up Capybara-RSpec integration in spec/spec_helper.rb:

  Model tests
                          Model tests  all you really need is the model class itself.
                            common usage for model tests is to make sure you have set up your validations correctly.
                            # spec/models/monster_spec.rb
  
  RSpec                   SEE ALSO RSPEC SECTION
                            By default, Rails uses Test::Unit for testing
                            rails new cool_app -T # DONT use rails test if using RSpec
                            gem 'rspec-rails' #insstall rspec
                            bundle install
                            bundle exec rails g rspec:install
  Test types  
    Controller Tests        might be better off using feature testing since a lot of the functionallity duplicated   
    acceptance test         is phrased in terms of features that provide value to the user. (It could also be called an 
                              integration test because it tests more than one piece of the system at once.)
    unit test               because it tests a single unit of functionality. it can be difficult to write isolated unit tests, 
                              and it's not always clear whether they're useful.

  EXAMPLES
  EX model test
                          describe Monster do     #model validity test
                            let(:attributes) do {  name: "Dustwing",      size: "tiny",  taxonomy: "Abradacus nonexistus"} /n end
                            it "is considered valid" do  expect(Monster.new(attributes)).to be_valid /n end
                          end

  Ex Testing for invalidation failure
                          let(:missing_name) { attributes.except(:name) }
                          let(:invalid_size) { attributes.merge(size: "not that big") }
                          let(:missing_species) { attributes.merge(taxonomy: "Abradacus") }
                          it "is invalid without a name" do expect(Monster.new(missing_name)).not_to be_valid en
                          it "is invalid with an unusual size" do expect(Monster.new(invalid_size)).not_to be_valid end
                          it "is invalid with a missing species" do expect(Monster.new(missing_species)).not_to be_valid end
  Ex capybara
                        # spec/features/monster_creation.rb
                        describe "monster creation", type: :feature do
                          before do
                            visit new_monster_path
                            fill_in "Name", with: "Dustwing"
                            select "tiny", from: "monster_size"
                            fill_in "Taxonomy", with: "Abradacus nonexistus"
                            click_button "Create Monster"
                          end
                        #  When click_button is called, this will trigger the POST request to the controller's create action, just as if a user had clicked it in their browser.
                        #  Now, we can write our original controller tests like usual:
                        let(:monster) { Monster.find_by(name: "Dustwing") }

YAML ********************************************************************************************
YAML        is used because it is easier for humans to read and write than typing out entire arrays, hashes, etc.
  ex
  commands  require 'yaml' # STEP ONE, REQUIRE YAML!
            # Parse a YAML string
            YAML.load("--- foo") #=> "foo"

            # Emit some YAML
            YAML.dump("foo")     # => "--- foo\n...\n"
            { :a => 'b'}.to_yaml  # => "---\n:a: b\n"
  
  ARRAY     All members of a list are lines beginning at the same indentation level starting with a "- " (a dash and a space):
            # fruits.yml
              - Apple
              - Orange
              - Strawberry
              - Mango
            # ruby file
            require "yaml" 
            fruits = YAML.load_file('fruits.yml')
            fruits             # => ["Apple","Orange","Strawberry","Mango"]
            
            OPTIONAL:: inline format ->  # Shopping list  /n  [milk, pumpkin pie, eggs, juice]
  HASH      # thisisahash.yml
            garfield: Orange
            tom: gray
            #ruby file
            require "yaml"
            cat = YAML.load_file('thisisahash.yml')
            cat # => # { "garfied" => "orange", "tom" => "gray"}
            
             --- # Indented Block
               name: John Smith
               age: 33
             --- # Inline Block
             {name: John Smith, age: 33}
  STRINGS   two ways to write multi-line strings, 
                one preserving newlines (using the | character) 
                one that folds the newlines (using the > character), both followed by a newline character.
