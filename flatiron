git add .                           to add your local changes to be committed.
git clone                           to clone a repository to your local computer.
                                        To clone, make sure you've clicked on the SSH link (it starts with git@github.com:
git commit -am "Commit Message"     to commit changes that have been added with a message.
git push                            to upload your local changes to GitHub.
git reset --hard <commit id>        revert
git status                          to see the status of your locally cloned git repository.

GITHUB FORK                         Forking is the process of making a personal copy of the Learn lab on GitHub
github pull request(web)            Submitting a pull request is how you submit your lab to be evaluated or graded 


RUBY *****************************************************************
ARGUMENTS
              calling methods with parentheses, e.g., greeting('Sophie'). 
                But you can also omit the parentheses: greeting 'Sophie'.
  default/optional    (name = "Ruby programmer"), we simply assign the argument name a default value of "Ruby programmer" 
  required+optional   def greeting(name, language="Ruby") # required MUST come before optional

DEBUGGING
  pry          gem install pry
               require "pry" on top of code 
               use the following line "binding.pry" anywhere in your code.
                When the interpreter hits that line, your program will actually freeze and your terminal 
                  will turn into a REPL(interpreter like irb)
  
VARIABLES   variables   words or characters that hold values
  constant    written in UPPERCASE or Capitalized. They have a global scope when defined globally, 
                and local scope when defined within classes and modules. 
                Constants cannot be defined within methods. When constants are initialized, they should not be reassigned.               
                cannot start with a number, be a Ruby reserved word, or have punctuation or space characters.
  Global variables  "global scope". accessed anywhere in a program and are declared with a dollar sign in front   
                      $global_variable
  Local variables   "local scope", meaning that their definitions remain where they are declared.
                      If we define a variable within a method definition, only the method knows about that variable                
  pass-by-value  A variable makes a copy of the value it holds and passes the copy over to something else that 
                  alters or changes it.   
                  ex "hello".upcase
  pass-by-reference. changes to a variable would alter what is stored in the actual location it refers to.
                After the process was complete the variable would be holding a new and different value.
                ex x=5                
  range       see RUBY->TYPES
  type        the type of the value a var holds. Ruby is what is known as a dynamically typed language. 
                means the value of a variable can change its type and does not need to be explicitly/permanently defined. 

TYPES
  Array
  range       see below  
  .sort
  .reverse

  Hash
        store objects differ from arrays in that they function like dictionaries. 
        hashes are composed of key/value pairs. Each key points to a specific value
          ––just like a word and a definition in a regular dictionary.
          {"i'm a key" => "i'm a value!", "key2" => "value2"}

  Numbers   
          Fixnums are whole numbers, like 7.
          Floats are decimal numbers, like 7.3.
  .ceil     7.5.ceil  => 8
  .floor    7.5.floor   => this method will round the float down to the nearest fixnum. Here it will return 7
  .next     10.next => 11
  
  Range     a set of values with a beginning and an end. A range can contain strings or integers.
            A range of strings: ("a", "b", "c", "d") A range of integers: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)
            A range can be constructed using this notation: (100..200) Or this notation: (100...200)
            .. ("double-dot") includes the second number (200) in the range, while using a ... ("triple-dot") excludes it.
            Ranges can be helpful when you are generating arrays which we will be learning more about soon.

  
  Strings
  .class      get class of any item.    "hello".class
  .reverse    "hello".reverse    => "olleh"
  .size       "hello".size    => 5
  .upcase     "hello".upcase  => "HELLO"

  Symbol
            symbol is a representation of a piece of data. Symbols look like this :my_symbol. 
            If I make a symbol, :my_symbol, and then use that symbol later on in my code,
                my program will refer to the same area of memory in both cases.


RSPEC ***************************************************************
  A test is always going to be about setting up a state with a known result and 
  comparing that known result or expectation to the behavior of your program, 
  thus ensuring that your program behaves as you expected.  

ERROR TYPES
  ARGUMENT ERRORS   occur when methods are passed either too few or too many arguments.
  NAME ERRORS       NameErrors are caused when a given name is invalid or undefined
  NO METHOD ERRORS  no method for something
                      will often occur when you have a variable set to nil
  Syntax errors     they're the result of incorrect syntax.
  TYPEERRORS        When you try and do a mathematical operation on two objects of a different type,


Structure
  require_relative '../a.rb'  #loads the code from our actual program file 
  describe "something" do     #we use the describe RSpec method and strings to describe what we are testing. 
                  This code is entirely for you, the programmer, and has very little meaning to RSpec or Ruby.
  it "returns something" do   #to state an expectation or behavior of that method.       
      "" is only there to provide you, the programmer, with a description of what behavior we're currently testing.
      #what is inside the "it do end" block is what we actually test      
  expect(age_of_person).to eq(19)   #expect var to equal value

SHELL ***************************************************************
commands    see https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Bash-Builtins.html
LS
    ls -lah        h is a suffix on the l flag meaning "human readable formats." 
                    a meaning "all information including permissions".
    la -a          show jidden files                
loop    for f in *.txt;do echo $f;done    
open  it will trigger the default action associated with the file type. $ open hello_world.rb
paths
  absolute path 
    points to the same location  regardless of the working directory. They start with / ("forward slash") 
    because that is the root of your file system. This is an absolute path: /Users/avi.
  relative path 
    path relative to the working directory of the user or application, 
    They start with the name of a directory or a file.This is a relative path: avi/Documents.
$PATH  list of directories that BASH will look in for commands, scripts, and programs.  type into shell
    edit .bash_profile to add/remove dirs
pipe    | symbol named "pipe", will send the output of one command into the input of another command.    
        $ ps aux | grep ruby
ps aux  get all processes
pwd   print working dir , get current dir
~     go home dir  , tilda
