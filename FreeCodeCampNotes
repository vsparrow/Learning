#CSS Classes are reusable styles that can be added to HTML elements.
#Note that in your CSS style element, classes should start with a period. 
#In your HTML elements' class declarations, classes shouldn't start with a period.
<style> 
 .red-text {color: red;}    ##anything with red-textlabe red,
  p {font-size: 16px;}      #anything in p is 16px
</style>  
<h2 class="red-text">CatPhotoApp</h2>

Remember that you can apply multiple classes to an element by separating each class with a space within its class attribute. 
<img class="class1 class2">
