Nesting just means putting one element inside of another element.
<a href=#> Replace the value of your a element's href attribute with a #, also known as a hash symbol, to turn it into a dead link.
<ul></ul>               #unordered lists
<ol></ol>               #ordered lists
<input type="text" placeholder="cat photo URL">  #input with placeholder texxt
<form action="/submit-cat-photo">
  <input type="text" placeholder="cat photo URL">
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
The div element, also known as a division element, is a general purpose container for other elements.
The div element is probably the most commonly used HTML element of all. It's useful for passing the CSS of its own class declarations down to all the elements that it contains.
<id>  each HTML element can also have an id attribut # <h2 id="cat-photo-app"> 
                        #decleare in style    #cat-photo-app {color: green;}     we use # for id, and . for class
                        id attribute will always take precedence of class
padding # UPDOWN An element's padding controls the amount of space between the element and its border.
padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px; #These four values work like a clock: top, right, bottom, left, Instead of specifying an element's padding-top, padding-right, padding-bottom, and padding-left
margin # LEFTRIGHTUPDOWN An element's margin controls the amount of space between an element's border and surrounding elements.
      #If you set an element's margin to a negative value, the element will grow larger.
margin: 10px 20px 10px 20px;
Every HTML page has a body element. you can style your body element just like any other HTML element, and all your other elements  inherit your body element's styles.




Style:
#Note that inside your style element, you always reference classes by putting a . in front of their names. 
#You always reference ids by putting a # in front of their names.
font-family: Sans-serif,Monospace;    #use certain fonts. if sans isnt available degrade to use Monospace.
.red-text {color: red;}     #anything with red-textlabe red,
font-size: 16px;            #font sizing
externalfonts: <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lobster" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
width: 500px;               #image width 500px
border-radius: 10px;        #round out those corners
border-radius: 50%;         #create circle of the image
class="class1 class2" # It doesn't matter which order the classes are listed in the HTML element. see example to left
                        #However, the order of the class declarations in the <style> section are what is important. 
                        #The second declaration will always take precedence over the first.. 
                        #ie if class1 comes after class2 in style declaration, class1 will take precedence, even if class2 applied after in html element
                        #, in the event of a conflict, the browser will use whichever CSS declaration came last.
inline    <h2 style="color: red"></h2> #changes everything in the h2 element red.  #this is inline style




css
<style>  h2 {color: blue;} </style>   #everything with the label h2 will be blue
<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>

#CSS Classes are reusable styles that can be added to HTML elements.
#Note that in your CSS style element, classes should start with a period. 
#In your HTML elements' class declarations, classes shouldn't start with a period.
<style> 
 .red-text {color: red;}    ##anything with red-textlabe red,
  p {font-size: 16px;}      #anything in p is 16px
</style>  
<h2 class="red-text">CatPhotoApp</h2>

Remember that you can apply multiple classes to an element by separating each class with a space within its class attribute. 
<img class="class1 class2">
