When you write something in a human language, what is written is called text. 
When you write something in a computer language, what is written is called code.

To make the code easier to read, 
colored parts of the code different colors. 
(For example, numbers are always green.)
Anything you are supposed to type in will be in a dotted box, 
anything a program prints out will be in a grey box
