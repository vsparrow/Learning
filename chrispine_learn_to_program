When you write something in a human language, what is written is called text. 
When you write something in a computer language, what is written is called code.

To make the code easier to read, 
colored parts of the code different colors. 
(For example, numbers are always green.)
Anything you are supposed to type in will be in a dotted box, 
anything a program prints out will be in a grey box

puts means PUT STRING
gets means GET STRING 

chomp of gets.chomp takes of eneter enterS at end of String
chomp also works for other variables too! no only gets

what is self? It's a special variable which points to whatever object you are in.

5 + 5 is really just a shortcut way of writing 5.+ 5.

Captials come BEFORE lowercase!

 The comparison methods aren't giving us the strings 'true' and 'false'; they are giving us the special objects true and false
 
  A computer, on the other hand, uses or to mean "one or the other, or both."
