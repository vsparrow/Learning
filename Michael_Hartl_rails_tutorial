Notation

the >= notation always installs the latest gem
 the ~> 4.0.0 notation only installs updated gems representing minor point releases (e.g., from 4.0.0 to 4.0.1), 
 but not major point releases (e.g., from 4.0 to 4.1). 
 
 Unfortunately, experience shows that even minor point releases can break things,

When interacting with a Rails application, a browser sends a request, which is received by a web server and passed on 
to a Rails controller, which is in charge of what to do next. In some cases, the controller will immediately render a view, 
which is a template that gets converted to HTML and sent back to the browser. More commonly for dynamic sites, the controller
interacts with a model, which is a Ruby object that represents an element of the site (such as a user) and is in charge of 
communicating with the database. After invoking the model, the controller then renders the view and returns the complete web page 
to the browser as HTML.
