Create Web Page
  Bootstrap uses HTML elements and CSS properties that require the HTML5 doctype.
  Always include the HTML5 doctype at the beginning of the page, along with the lang attribute and the correct character set:
    <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang="en"> <head> <meta charset="utf-8">  </head> </html>
Bootstrap 3 is mobile-first
  To ensure proper rendering and touch zooming, add the following <meta> tag inside the <head> element:
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
      width=device-width sets width of page to follow screen-width of the device (which will vary depending on the device).
      The initial-scale=1 sets initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser.


Alerts:
  created with the .alert class, followed by one of the four contextual classes .alert-success, .alert-info, .alert-warning or .alert-danger:
  close alert:  To close the alert message, add class="close" and data-dismiss="alert" to a link or a button element:
     <div class="alert alert-info">
    <a href="#" class="close" data-dismiss="alert" aria-label="close">&times;</a>
    <strong>Info!</strong> This alert box could indicate a neutral informative change or action.  </div>
  Animated Alerts   The .fade and .in classes adds a fading effect when closing the alert message:

Badges are numerical indicators of how many items are associated with a link: 
  Use the .badge class within <span> elements to create badges:
  Badges can also be used inside other elements, such as buttons:
    <a href="#">News <span class="badge">5</span></a><br>

Buttons:
  For <button> elements, you must wrap each button in a .btn-group class:
  seven styles of buttons:  .btn-default .btn-primary .btn-success .btn-info .btn-warning  .btn-danger  .btn-link
  four button sizes: .btn-lg .btn-md .btn-sm .btn-xs
  block level button spans the entire width of the parent element. .btn-block
  Active/Disabled Buttons  A button can be set to an active (appear pressed) or a disabled (unclickable) state:
    .active makes a button appear pressed, and the class .disabled makes a button unclickable:
  Button Groups   group a series of buttons together (on a single line) in a button group:
    Use a <div> element with class .btn-group to create a button group:
  Vertical Button Groups Use the class .btn-group-vertical to create a vertical button group:
  Justified Button Groups To span the entire width of the screen, use the .btn-group-justified class:
  Nesting Button Groups & Dropdown Menus
     <div class="btn-group">
      <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary dropdown-toggle" data-toggle="dropdown">
      Sony <span class="caret"></span></button>
        <ul class="dropdown-menu" role="menu"> <li><a href="#">Tablet</a></li> <li><a href="#">Smartphone</a></li> </ul>

Collapsible    useful when you want to hide and show large amount of content:
   Explained 
    The .collapse class indicates a collapsible element (a <div> in our example); 
      this is the content that will be shown or hidden with a click of a button.
      To control (show/hide) the collapsible content, add the data-toggle="collapse" attribute to an <a> or a <button> element. 
        Then add the data-target="#id" attribute to connect the button with the collapsible content (<div id="demo">).
        Note: For <a> elements, you can use the href attribute instead of the data-target attribute:
    <button data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#demo">Collapsible</button><div id="demo" class="collapse">Lorem ipsum dolor text....</div>
  .in class to show the content by default: By default, the collapsible content is hidden. 
  Accordions are useful when you want to toggle between hiding and showing large amount of content:
  data-parent attribute use to make sure that all collapsible elements under the specified parent will be closed when one of the collapsible item is shown.

      The .caret class creates a caret arrow icon (), which indicates that the button is a dropdown.
      Add the .dropdown-menu class to a <ul> element to actually build the dropdown menu.
        <div class="dropdown"> 
          <button class="btn btn-primary dropdown-toggle" type="button" data-toggle="dropdown">Dropdown Example <span class="caret"></span></button>
            <ul class="dropdown-menu"> <li><a href="#">HTML</a></li><li><a href="#">CSS</a></li>  <li><a href="#">JavaScript</a></li>
            </ul>
        </div>
