Create Web Page
  Bootstrap uses HTML elements and CSS properties that require the HTML5 doctype.
  Always include the HTML5 doctype at the beginning of the page, along with the lang attribute and the correct character set:
    <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang="en"> <head> <meta charset="utf-8">  </head> </html>
Bootstrap 3 is mobile-first
  To ensure proper rendering and touch zooming, add the following <meta> tag inside the <head> element:
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
      width=device-width sets width of page to follow screen-width of the device (which will vary depending on the device).
      The initial-scale=1 sets initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser.
Containers
  Bootstrap requires a containing element to wrap site contents.
    two container classes
      .container class responsive FIXED WIDTH container
      .container-fluid class FULL WIDTH container, spanning the entire width of the viewport
        Note: Containers are not nestable (you cannot put a container inside another container).
Grid System
  <div class="row">  <div class="col-*-*"></div> </div>
  up to 12 columns across the page. use all 12 column individually, or group the columns together to create wider columns:
  classes: xs (for phones) sm (for tablets) md (for desktops) lg (for larger desktops)
Text
  default settings:
    font 14px   line-height of 1.428. <p> half of line-height (10px by default).
  abbriviate:
    <abbr> tag defines an abbreviation or an acronym, like "Mr.", "Dec.", "ASAP", "ATM".
      <abbr title="World Health Organization" >WHO</abbr>
      Tip: An abbreviation and an acronym are both shortened versions of something else. 
      Marking up abbreviations can give useful information to browsers, translation systems and search-engines.
    .initialism 	Displays the text inside an <abbr> element in a slightly smaller font size
      <abbr title="World Health Organization" class="initialism">WHO</abbr>
  blockquote <blockquote>
   .blockquote-reverse To show the quote on the right
  code  <code>Place CODE HERE</code> shows code on page
    <pre>For multiple lines of code, use the pre element:<pre>multiple code lines here </pre>
      Text in a pre elementis displayed in a fixed-width font, and it preservesboth spaces andline breaks.
    .pre-scrollable 	Makes a <pre> element scrollable  
  Colors: 
      Text colors: some contextual classes that can be used to provide "meaning through colors".
        .text-muted gray , .text-primary  blue, .text-success  green 
        .text-info  bluegreen .text-warning  yellow, and .text-danger  red
      Text background colors (HIGHLIGHTING)

  double underline <abbr>
  heading
    <small> element is used to create a lighter, secondary text in any heading:
  highlight <mark>
  kbd : keyboard inputs  <kbd>ctrl + p</kbd>  To indicate input that is typically entered via the keyboard, use the kbd element:
  list:
    .list-unstyled 	Removes the default list-style and left margin on list items (works on both <ul> and <ol>). 
      This class only applies to immediate children list items (to remove the default list-style from any nested lists, 
      apply this class to any nested lists as well)
    .list-inline 	Places all list items on a single line
    .dl-horizontal 	Lines up the terms (<dt>) and descriptions (<dd>) in <dl> elements side-by-side. 
      Starts off like default <dl>s, but when the browser window expands, it will line up side-by-side
  .lead 	Makes a paragraph stand out
  .small 	Indicates smaller text (set to 85% of the size of the parent)
  .text-left 	Indicates left-aligned text 	
  .text-center 	Indicates center-aligned text 	
  .text-right 	Indicates right-aligned text 	
  .text-justify 	Indicates justified text 	(start at next line if needed)
  .text-nowrap 	Indicates no wrap text  (will force sccroll bar if needed)
  .text-lowercase 	Indicates lowercased text 	
  .text-uppercase 	Indicates uppercased text
