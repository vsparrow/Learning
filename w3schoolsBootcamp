Create Web Page
  Bootstrap uses HTML elements and CSS properties that require the HTML5 doctype.
  Always include the HTML5 doctype at the beginning of the page, along with the lang attribute and the correct character set:
    <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang="en"> <head> <meta charset="utf-8">  </head> </html>
Bootstrap 3 is mobile-first
  To ensure proper rendering and touch zooming, add the following <meta> tag inside the <head> element:
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
      width=device-width sets width of page to follow screen-width of the device (which will vary depending on the device).
      The initial-scale=1 sets initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser.
Containers
  Bootstrap requires a containing element to wrap site contents.
    two container classes
      .container class responsive FIXED WIDTH container
      .container-fluid class FULL WIDTH container, spanning the entire width of the viewport
        Note: Containers are not nestable (you cannot put a container inside another container).
Grid System
  <div class="row">  <div class="col-*-*"></div> </div>
  up to 12 columns across the page. use all 12 column individually, or group the columns together to create wider columns:
  classes: xs (for phones) sm (for tablets) md (for desktops) lg (for larger desktops)

IMAGES/media
    .img-rounded class adds rounded corners to an image (IE8 does not support rounded corners):
    .img-circle class shapes the image to a circle (IE8 does not support rounded corners):
    .img-thumbnail class shapes the image to a thumbnail:
    .img-responsive images comes in all sizes. So do screens. Responsive images automatically adjust to fit the size of the screen.
        The image will then scale nicely to the parent element.The .img-responsive class applies display: block; and max-width: 100%; and height: auto; to the image:
     image gallery:  use Bootstrap's grid system in conjunction with the .thumbnail class to create an image gallery:   
     Responsive Embeds  let videos or slideshows scale properly on any device.
      applied directly to <iframe>, <embed>, <video>, and <object> elements.  The containing <div> defines the aspect ratio of the video:
        <div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9"><iframe class="embed-responsive-item" src="..."></iframe></div>

      <abbr title="World Health Organization" >WHO</abbr>
      Tip: An abbreviation and an acronym are both shortened versions of something else. 
      Marking up abbreviations can give useful information to browsers, translation systems and search-engines.

      <abbr title="World Health Organization" class="initialism">WHO</abbr>
  blockquote <blockquote>
   .blockquote-reverse To show the quote on the right
  code  <code>Place CODE HERE</code> shows code on page

  list:
    .list-unstyled 	Removes the default list-style and left margin on list items (works on both <ul> and <ol>).

    .dl-horizontal 	Lines up the terms (<dt>) and descriptions (<dd>) in <dl> elements side-by-side.
