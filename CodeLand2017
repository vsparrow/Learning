* Break goals into smaller ones.
* Small projects using different frameworks gives you confidence to build more, bigger.
* Projects get people's attention.
* Made a Pi hardware, people on internet can control it, indirectly project helped get job.

Talk - Websites are video games waiting to happen - Opher Vishnia
* Juice -> max output for min input, find it
* Physics events like camera shaking event makes video/website event seem powerful

Talk - Running into your Ex at a party : Elements of a successful game - Chris Algoo
