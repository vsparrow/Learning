Chapter1: 
There are six basic types of values in JavaScript: numbers, strings, Booleans, objects, functions, and undefined values.
2.998e8 means 2.998 * 10^8 = 299,900,00  
Infinity and -Infinity, which represent the positive and negative infinities. Infinity - 1 is still Infinity, and so on. 
  Don’t put too much trust in infinity-based computation. It isn’t mathematically solid,  
NaN stands for “not a number”
  You’ll get this when, for example, (0/ 0), or any number of other numeric operations that don’t yield a  meaningful result.
  There is only one value in JavaScript that is not equal to itself, and that is NaN, which stands for “not a number”.
    console.log(NaN == NaN)  // → false
typeof operator, which produces a string value naming the type of the value you give it.  
  typeof 4.5 => number   typeof "x" => string
binary operators: operators that take 2 values, example minus
  9-2
unary operators operators that take one value example minus 
  -10
*minus can be binary or unary operator
