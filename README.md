Review: Very good, I think it was great for an introductory course on Ruby. Would recommend to others. This way the course was taught it was very hands on, which is very helpful. Also the notes and hints assist in allowing one to progress and learn without getting stuck. One thing I noticed was that the website was checking for certain "things", places where I knew the code was correct, but I had to move it up a line to get it to be as expected by the checker. WHile there are quirks, its nothing that detracts from the course.

Review: OK, was a nice refresher after going in depth from the Udacity course, but if I had taken this first I don't think I would have had the same understanding.
