Michael Hartl: Tutorial

Review: It is actually a very helpful book, everything is laid out A-Z, and is easy to follow along. I got up to chapter 8, and midway through I was having some difficulty diagnosing a problem. Previous issues I was able to resolve as error messages would point me in the right direction. This error with the Logged in upper menu bar was giving a problem because there was no actual "error" coming up but it was wrong. Then I realzied that I really didnt know what to look for. I have a 101 introduction to Rails now thanks to the book, but I should also try some beginner Rails courses before I come back. 
I think that second time around I should have a clear understanding of what I am doing rather than immitating what MHartl is writing.  
I did get a taste of Gemfiles, app, config folders bundling, heroku, cloud ide, etc so it has been productive.

Review: Very good book, friendly to use with tons of examples in the book a well as assignments. THe last few chapters realy brought it together, making it feel like I am a programmer rather than someone copy and pasting some text, which is helpful to for a beginner like myself. It came highly recommnded and I would recomend to others.  
  
Codeschool: Ruby Bits : Incomplete
Started Jan 04 2016
Cancelled Jan 13 2016
https://www.codeschool.com/courses/ruby-bits
Review: This is not really an intro course to Ruby or Ruby on Rails. It is better designed for a more experianced rubist. The examples were very good and I feel I should come back to it. There is a lot of value to take from the course, but I am not at the level to gain the best info I can from the course. This is more of a Rails course than ruby. Well, its actually a code ruby practices type course so far, but many of hte examples assumes rails familiarity.

Codeschool: try ruby  
Started Jan 03 2016  
Finished Jan 04 2016
https://www.codeschool.com/paths/ruby  
Review: Mixed opinion. Not a very good course, not much explanation compared to codeacedemy, reviews from others say codeschool is no good, this reinforces  that opinion for myself. This wasn't even a review of material it was jsut a handful of excercies. However if I look at it in the context of, this is "try ruby", not "learn ruby", the the course does exactly that. Appears greared towards those already familiar with coding, who want to try a small part of the language without any investment in installing anything.  
Wouldn't recommend.  

Codeacademy: Learn Ruby  
Started Dec 27 2015

Review: Very good, I think it was great for an introductory course on Ruby. Would recommend to others. This way the course was taught it was very hands on, which is very helpful. Also the notes and hints assist in allowing one to progress and learn without getting stuck. One thing I noticed was that the website was checking for certain "things", places where I knew the code was correct, but I had to move it up a line to get it to be as expected by the checker. WHile there are quirks, its nothing that detracts from the course.  
Was Free version not Pro.  

Codeacademy: Learn Git

Review: OK, was a nice refresher after going in depth from the Udacity course, but if I had taken this first I don't think I would have had the same understanding.
