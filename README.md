An event and not a course, there was a some learning along the way. A great environment and friendly folks. Tte mock technical interview workshop helped show what a abck and forth between interviewer and intrvieee should look like. The workshop was helpful in makeing logarighm a little more clear. 

The Web Developer Bootcamp - Colt Steele

Review: Probably the best course on the internet for new devs. Well spoken, and course layed out in a clear manner. Even content that I found was review was still informative and learned some new things. A true full stack course that has introduced me to MongoDB, mongoose, and express. Some of the content was similar to what I did earlier in Ruby on Rails, but the RESTful routing is more clear now.

Cancelled 2017
Review: A good book that should be went over again. Gets deep into the nooks of JS, at the current level I am at, where I only had 1-2 hours a day to allocate, tiem was better spent reviewing basics. Will need to come back.

Review: Good reivew on the basics. After completing FCC javascript, I was having some problems with FCC random quote generator. While this hasn't directly helped me solve the problem, it has helped me cement some fundamentals.

Realize FreeCodeCamp is VERY bootstrap dependent. THe philosophy of FCC to have a future dev search out for answers to problems rather than handing it out is applaudable, as that is how actual dev jobs are, you acquire knowledge that you don't have. Here i think a small course on bootstrap will allow me to get frther faster. Will return to FCC.  

FreeCodeCamp    
Started 4/18/16    
Finished 2017  
Starting free code camp, it appears to be the best prospect of path to employeability. While I think I have a good understanding of rails I don't feel like I have a good understanding of hte font-end, which may or may not be useful. So far the interactive site and community seems interesting. Just scratched the surface. Keep reading on cscareerquestions it's not what language you know but how you problem solve. There seem to be a lot of problems to solve here.


Getting Started with Rails
http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html  
Started March 10 2016  
Finished March 14 2016  
Starting this at same time as Udemy course below, when offsite, video via RDP is no good.
Nice little intro guide, most errors were all fatfingers. Troubleshooting the fatfingers, with having the rails guide as a "cheet sheet" was helpful in getting to learn the app folder structure. Nothing like hands on troublshooting.  

Learn Ruby on Rails from scratch

Review: Windows oriented, some good explanations.

Michael Hartl: Tutorial  
Started Feb 06 2016  
Cancelled March 4 2016
https://www.railstutorial.org/book/beginning  
Review: It is actually a very helpful book, everything is laid out A-Z, and is easy to follow along. I got up to chapter 8, and midway through I was having some difficulty diagnosing a problem. Previous issues I was able to resolve as error messages would point me in the right direction. This error with the Logged in upper menu bar was giving a problem because there was no actual "error" coming up but it was wrong. Then I realzied that I really didnt know what to look for. I have a 101 introduction to Rails now thanks to the book, but I should also try some beginner Rails courses before I come back. 
I think that second time around I should have a clear understanding of what I am doing rather than immitating what MHartl is writing.  
I did get a taste of Gemfiles, app, config folders bundling, heroku, cloud ide, etc so it has been productive.  

Chris Pine : Learn to Program  
Started Jan 13 2016 
Finished Feb 01 2016
https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram  
Review: Very good book, friendly to use with tons of examples in the book a well as assignments. THe last few chapters realy brought it together, making it feel like I am a programmer rather than someone copy and pasting some text, which is helpful to for a beginner like myself. It came highly recommnded and I would recomend to others.  
  
Codeschool: Ruby Bits : Incomplete
Started Jan 04 2016
Cancelled Jan 13 2016
https://www.codeschool.com/courses/ruby-bits
Review: This is not really an intro course to Ruby or Ruby on Rails. It is better designed for a more experianced rubist. The examples were very good and I feel I should come back to it. There is a lot of value to take from the course, but I am not at the level to gain the best info I can from the course. This is more of a Rails course than ruby. Well, its actually a code ruby practices type course so far, but many of hte examples assumes rails familiarity.

Codeschool: try ruby  
Started Jan 03 2016  
Finished Jan 04 2016
https://www.codeschool.com/paths/ruby  
Review: Mixed opinion. Not a very good course, not much explanation compared to codeacedemy, reviews from others say codeschool is no good, this reinforces  that opinion for myself. This wasn't even a review of material it was jsut a handful of excercies. However if I look at it in the context of, this is "try ruby", not "learn ruby", the the course does exactly that. Appears greared towards those already familiar with coding, who want to try a small part of the language without any investment in installing anything.  
Wouldn't recommend.  

Codeacademy: Learn Ruby  
Started Dec 27 2015
Finished Jan 03 2016
https://www.codecademy.com/learn/ruby  
Review: Very good, I think it was great for an introductory course on Ruby. Would recommend to others. This way the course was taught it was very hands on, which is very helpful. Also the notes and hints assist in allowing one to progress and learn without getting stuck. One thing I noticed was that the website was checking for certain "things", places where I knew the code was correct, but I had to move it up a line to get it to be as expected by the checker. WHile there are quirks, its nothing that detracts from the course.  
Was Free version not Pro.  

Codeacademy: Learn Git

Finished Dec 26 2015  
https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git  
Review: OK, was a nice refresher after going in depth from the Udacity course, but if I had taken this first I don't think I would have had the same understanding.   
Was Free version not Pro.
